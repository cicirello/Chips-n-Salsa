/**
 * This class implements an insertion mutation on permutations, where one mutation consists in
 * removing a randomly chosen element and reinserting it at a different randomly chosen location.
 * The removed element is chosen uniformly at random from among all possible elements, and the new
 * location is chosen uniformly at random from among all possible new locations.
 *
 * <p>The runtime (worst case and average case) of both the {@link #mutate(Permutation) mutate} and
 * {@link #undo(Permutation) undo} methods is O(n), where n is the length of the permutation. The
 * worst case runtime occurs when the removed element is at one end of the permutation, and
 * reinserted at the opposite end, which causes all n permutation elements to move one position
 * each. On average, an insertion mutation moves approximately n/3 elements.
