/**
 * This class implements the Cycle(kmax) form of cycle mutation on permutations, where one mutation
 * generates a random permutation cycle. Given the original parent permutation and its mutant, a
 * permutation cycle can be defined as follows. Imagine a graph with n vertexes, where n is the
 * permutation length. Now consider that for each index i, we define an edge in that graph between
 * vertex parent[i] and vertex mutant[i]. A permutation cycle consists of all of the elements from
 * one of the cycles in that graph. The length of a cycle is the number of elements in it. Consider
 * an example permutation, p1 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], and another permutation, p2 = [0, 3, 2, 1, 4]. This
 * pair of permutations has a 2-cycle (i.e., a cycle of length 2) consisting of elements 1 and 3.
 * Consider a second example, p1 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], and p2 = [0, 4, 2, 1, 3]. This example has a
 * 3-cycle consisting of elements 1, 3, and 4. Notice that position 1 has elements 1 and 4, position
 * 4 has elements 4 and 3, and position 3 has elements 3 and 1, so in the hypothetical graph
 * described above, there would be an edges from 1 to 4, 4 to 3, and 3 to 1, a cycle of length 3.
 *
 * <p>The Cycle(kmax) version of cycle mutation chooses the cycle size k uniformly at random from
 * [2, kmax], and then creates a random k-element cycle. The kmax is a parameter allowing the
 * evolutionary algorithm implementer the ability to control the allowed range of cycle sizes. The
 * combination of k elements is chosen uniformly at random from all possible combinations of k
 * elements. Note that a 2-cycle is simply a swap.
 *
 * <p>The runtime of the {@link #mutate(Permutation) mutate} method is O(min(n, kmax<sup>2</sup>)),
 * and derives from the combination of algorithms utilized by the {@link EnhancedSplittableGenerator
 * EnhancedSplittableGenerator} class in sampling k random integers. For small values of kmax, the
 * runtime is essentially constant. The runtime of the {@link #undo(Permutation) undo} method is
 * O(kmax).
 *
