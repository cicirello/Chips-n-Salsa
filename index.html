<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Chips-n-Salsa is a <span itemprop="programmingLanguage">Java</span> library 
of customizable, hybridizable, iterative, parallel, stochastic, and self-adaptive 
local search algorithms.  The library includes implementations of several 
stochastic local search algorithms, including simulated annealing, hill climbers, 
as well as constructive search algorithms such as stochastic sampling. Chips-n-Salsa 
now also includes genetic algorithms as well as evolutionary algorithms more generally. 
The library very extensively supports simulated annealing. It includes several 
classes for representing solutions to a variety of optimization problems. For 
example, the library includes a BitVector class that implements vectors of bits, 
as well as classes for representing solutions to problems where we are searching 
for an optimal vector of integers or reals. For each of the built-in representations, 
the library provides the most common mutation operators for generating random 
neighbors of candidate solutions, as well as common crossover operators for use with 
evolutionary algorithms. Additionally, the library provides extensive 
support for permutation optimization problems, including implementations of many 
different mutation operators for permutations, and utilizing the efficiently 
implemented Permutation class of 
the <a href="https://jpt.cicirello.org/">JavaPermutationTools 
(JPT)</a> library.</p> 
<p>Chips-n-Salsa is customizable, making extensive use of Java's generic types, 
enabling using the library to optimize other types of representations beyond what 
is provided in the library. It is hybridizable, providing support for integrating 
multiple forms of local search (e.g., using a hill climber on a solution generated 
by simulated annealing), creating hybrid mutation operators (e.g., local search 
using multiple mutation operators), as well as support for running more than 
one type of search for the same problem concurrently using multiple threads as a 
form of algorithm portfolio. Chips-n-Salsa is iterative, with support for multistart 
metaheuristics, including implementations of several restart schedules for varying 
the run lengths across the restarts. It also supports parallel execution of multiple 
instances of the same, or different, stochastic local search algorithms for an 
instance of a problem to accelerate the search process. The library supports 
self-adaptive search in a variety of ways, such as including implementations of 
adaptive annealing schedules for simulated annealing, such as the Modified Lam 
schedule, implementations of the simpler annealing schedules but which self-tune 
the initial temperature and other parameters, and restart schedules that adapt to 
run length.</p>

<h3>Importing from Maven Central</h3>
<div class="badge-height"><a href="https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.cicirello/chips-n-salsa/"><amp-img class="contain" layout="fill" alt="Latest release on Maven Central" src="https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.cicirello/chips-n-salsa.svg?label=Maven%20Central&logo=apachemaven"></amp-img></a></div>
<p>To import Chips-n-Salsa from the Maven Central repository (if your build tool is
Maven), add the following to the dependencies section of 
your &ldquo;pom.xml&rdquo; (for other build tools, see your build 
tool's documentation for the equivalent):</p>
<pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.cicirello&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;chips-n-salsa&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;x.y.z&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Just replace <code>x.y.z</code> with your desired version of the library.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Java Modules</h3>
<p>The library provides a Java module, org.cicirello.chips_n_salsa. If your project uses Java modules,
then add the following to your module-info.java:</p>
<pre><code>
module your.module.name.here {
    requires org.cicirello.chips_n_salsa;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Chips-n-Salsa transitively requires the org.cicirello.jpt module from its
dependency on the <a href="https://jpt.cicirello.org/">JavaPermutationTools 
(JPT)</a> library because the functionality for optimizing permutation problems
accepts Permutation objects, defined in JPT, as parameters to methods and returns such objects
from other methods. So if your project utilizes any functionality from JPT, you shouldn't
need to explicitly require the org.cicirello.jpt module. JPT in turn transitively requires
the modules provided by the <a href="https://rho-mu.cicirello.org/">&rho;&mu;</a>
and <a href="https://core.cicirello.org/">org.cicirello.core</a> libraries. Your 
dependency manager (see previous section) will handle downloading these for you.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Semantic Versioning</h3>
<p>Chips-n-Salsa uses <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a> with 
version numbers of the form: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, where differences in MAJOR 
correspond to incompatible API changes, differences in MINOR correspond 
to introduction of backwards compatible new functionality, and PATCH 
corresponds to backwards compatible bug fixes.</p> 
</section>
<section>
<h3>Development Process</h3>
To maintain a high quality library, our development process utilizes
the following:
<ul>
<li>Test Coverage: We require unit tests for all functionality. We generate 
<a href="https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/">JaCoCo</a> test coverage 
reports on all push and pull-request events to
the source code repository. Although we don't 
have a strict minimum coverage for acceptance,
coverage is usually over 90%, and quite often 
at or near 100%. Current coverage
is reported in the readme of the GitHub 
repository (updated automatically).</li>
<li>Regression Testing: All new and existing tests are 
executed as part of all pull requests,
and all must pass for acceptance.</li>
<li>Static Analysis: We use multiple static analysis 
tools to scan for potential 
vulnerabilities, error prone code, and other 
potential code improvements. At the 
present time, this includes running:
<ul>

<li><a href="https://github.com/jimbethancourt/RefactorFirst">RefactorFirst</a></li>
<li><a href="https://snyk.io/">Snyk</a></li>
<li><a href="https://lift.sonatype.com/">Lift</a>: Sonatype's 
Lift runs a suite of several tools that includes 
Google's <a href="https://errorprone.info/">Errorprone</a>, 
Facebook's <a href="https://fbinfer.com/">Infer</a>, 
as well as <a href="https://find-sec-bugs.github.io/">FindSecBugs</a>,
among others.</li>

<h3>Related Publications</h3>
<p>The following is a list of publications that either 
influenced the design of the Chips-n-Salsa
library, or which directly used code from the library. In 
many cases, the papers in the list
used earlier implementations of library contents, 
but which has since been reimplemented.
For example, much of the library's code was originally 
written specifically for permutation
optimization problems (i.e., optimization problems, 
such as the traveling salesperson, for 
which we are searching the space of permutations). However, 
much of this code has been heavily
refactored (in some cases rewritten from scratch) to use 
Java generic types enabling 
application to many other types of optimization problem, 
including real-valued function 
optimization. Additionally, the code in the Chips-n-Salsa 
library has been optimized for 
execution speed, such as utilizing more efficient random 
number generators than was used in
some of these prior publications.</p>
