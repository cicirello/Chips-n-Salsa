/**
 * The implementations of constructive heuristics and stochastic samplers biased by constructive
 * heuristics in the library support incremental updates, as the solution is heuristically
 * assembled, to problem and/or heuristic data utilized by the heuristic. Implementations of this
 * interface depend upon the specific optimization problem, as well as the specific constructive
 * heuristic. For example, for a scheduling problem, it would be more efficient to compute the
 * current time in the schedule incrementally as the schedule is built than it would be to recompute
 * it each time a job is added to the schedule. Or, for example, there may be a constructive
 * heuristic for a problem that utilizes a characteristic of the portion of the problem not yet
 * solved for which it would be more efficient to compute incrementally than to recompute fresh each
 * step of the problem solving process.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of Partial object that this IncrementalEvaluation evaluates, which is assumed
 *     to be an object that is a sequence of integers (e.g., vector of integers, permutation, or
 *     some other indexable type that stores integers).

   *
   * <p>This extension is problem-dependent and this IncrementalEvaluation includes maintenance of
   * any data for which incremental updates as the Partial is gradually transformed into a full T is
   * beneficial to performance. For example, for a scheduling problem, the IncrementalEvaluation
