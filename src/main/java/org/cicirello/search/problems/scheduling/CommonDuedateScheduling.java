/**
 * This class represents and generates instances of a common duedate scheduling problem, in which
 * all jobs have both an earliness weight and a tardiness weight, and share a common duedate. The
 * library treats scheduling cost functions independently from the job data, however, the only
 * commonly used cost function that really makes sense with this combination of job characteristics
 * is the sum of weighted earliness plus weighted tardiness, implemented in the class {@link
 * WeightedEarlinessTardiness}. Consult the documentation of that class for details. There is
 * nothing to prevent you, however, from defining a scheduling problem involving the
 * CommonDuedateScheduling job characteristics with a different scheduling cost function. However,
 * be aware that the {@link #getCompletionTimes} method is implemented to assume the {@link
 * WeightedEarlinessTardiness} cost function, in that it computes the optimal delay to the start of
 * the schedule relative to the permutation it is passed as a parameter. That delay is likely
 * inappropriate for other cost functions.
 *
 * <p>This class generates instances using a procedure based on that used to generate the benchmark
 * instances for common duedate scheduling that are available in the <a
 * href=http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mastjjb/jeb/orlib/schinfo.html>OR-Library of J.E. Beasley</a>.

 * implementation is based on the description of that generator. That <a
