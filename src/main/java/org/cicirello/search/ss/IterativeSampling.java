/**
 * Iterative sampling is the simplest possible form of a stochastic sampling search. In iterative
 * sampling, the search generates N random candidate solutions to the problem, each sampled
 * uniformly at random from the space of possible solutions. It evaluates each of the N candidate
 * solutions with respect to the optimization problem's cost function, and returns the best of the N
 * candidate solutions.
