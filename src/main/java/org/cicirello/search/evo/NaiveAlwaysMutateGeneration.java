/**
 * An NaiveAlwaysMutateGeneration is the common cycle of: select, apply crossover to pairs of
 * parents based on C, apply mutation to each population member with rate M, replace. However, it is
 * the special case when M=1.0, such that every member of the population is mutated once in each
 * generation.
 *
 * @deprecated <b>IMPORTANT:</b> Use {@link AlwaysMutateGeneration} instead, which is highly
 *     optimized and significantly more efficient than this NaiveAlwaysMutateGeneration class. The
 *     NaiveAlwaysMutateGeneration class serves a very specific research purpose. This class is
 *     being introduced temporarily in support of research experiments. It is likewise being
 *     deprecated in the same release that introduces it. It will be removed in a future release
 *     with no further notice once it fulfills its research purpose. That removal will not be
 *     considered a breaking change since library users have been notified at class introduction,
 *     and should thus not depend upon it in the first place.
 * @param <T> The type of object under optimization.
