/**
 * The Parallel Variable Annealing Length (P-VAL) restart schedule originated, as you would expect
 * from the word "annealing" in its name, as a restart schedule for Simulated Annealing.
 * Specifically, it is a parallel version of the Variable Annealing Length (VAL) restart schedule.
 * Its intended use is to schedule the run lengths for restarts across a set of parallel multistart
 * metaheuristics. See the {@link VariableAnnealingLength} class for the sequential version of this
 * restart schedule.
 *
 * <p>The motivation underlying P-VAL is two-fold. First, a commonly encountered observation is that
 * a single long run of simulated annealing usually outperforms multiple short runs whose combined
 * length is that of the long run (assuming the annealing schedule is tuned well). Second, it is
 * often the case that we don't know beforehand how long of a run we have time to execute, thus our
 * annealing schedule may not be tuned properly for our available time (e.g., we may cool too
 * quickly or too slowly).
 *
 * <p>The sequential version of the restart schedule, known as VAL, starts with a short run, and
 * increases run length exponentially across restarts. Specifically, define r<sub>i</sub> as the run
 * length for run i, with the following: r<sub>i</sub> = 1000 * 2<sup>i</sup>. For simulated
 * annealing, run length is number of evaluations (i.e., iterations of the simulated annealing main
 * loop). You can compute the sequence of run lengths incrementally with r<sub>0</sub> = 1000 and
 * r<sub>i</sub> = 2r<sub>i-1</sub>. The first few run lengths in the sequence are: 1000, 2000,
 * 4000, ....
 *
 * <p>P-VAL is a parallel version of VAL. Its essence is the same sequence of restarts, but those
 * restart run lengths are spread across a maximum of 4 parallel instances of the search. If there
 * are more than 4 parallel instances, the schedule repeats with more than one search following the
 * same schedule. The run length, r<sub>i,t</sub>, of restart i of thread t is as follows:
 * r<sub>i,t</sub> = 1000 * 2<sup>(t mod 4) + i*min(4,N)</sup>, where i begins at 0, N is the number
 * of parallel search instances (i.e., threads), and the thread id t is an integer in [0, N). Note
 * that we do not implement this with an actual exponentiation. Rather, each run length of the
 * sequence is computed incrementally from the prior run length. Here are a few examples:
 *
 * <p>Example 1 (N=3): Thread 0 follows the schedule of run lengths: 1000, 8000, 64000, .... Thread
 * 1 follows the schedule of run lengths: 2000, 16000, 128000, .... Thread 2 follows the schedule of
 * run lengths: 4000, 32000, 256000, ....
 *
 * <p>Example 2 (N=4): Thread 0 follows the schedule of run lengths: 1000, 16000, 256000, ....
 * Thread 1 follows the schedule of run lengths: 2000, 32000, 512000, .... Thread 2 follows the
 * schedule of run lengths: 4000, 64000, 1024000, .... Thread 3 follows the schedule of run lengths:
 * 8000, 128000, 2048000, ....
 *
 * <p>Example 3 (N&gt;4): Thread 0 follows the schedule of run lengths: 1000, 16000, 256000, ....
 * Thread 1 follows the schedule of run lengths: 2000, 32000, 512000, .... Thread 2 follows the
 * schedule of run lengths: 4000, 64000, 1024000, .... Thread 3 follows the schedule of run lengths:
 * 8000, 128000, 2048000, .... Thread t, where t&ge;4, follows the same schedule of run lengths as
 * thread (t-4).
 *
 * <p>See the original publication, referenced below, for the theoretical rationale for beginning
 * the schedule fresh every 4 threads, along with an experimental comparison between P-VAL and a
 * preliminary version referred to in that paper as P-VAL-0, which did not start anew every 4
 * threads, as validation of that theoretical result.
 *
 * <p>This class supports both the original schedule as defined above, as well as including a
 * parameter to specify the initial run length r<sub>0,0</sub> as something other than 1000.
 *
 * <p>Although not originally stated in the paper that proposed this restart schedule, this
 * implementation converges to a constant restart length of Integer.MAX_VALUE if the next run length
 * of the schedule would otherwise exceed the maximum positive 32-bit integer value.
 *
 * <p>Since this restart schedule assumes multiple threads, and since each thread requires its own
 * RestartSchedule object that maintains state independent of the others, we do not provide a public
 * constructor for this class. Instead, we provide a couple static factory methods, {@link
 * #createRestartSchedules(int)} and {@link #createRestartSchedules(int,int)}, each of which create
 * an array of restart schedules for the desired number of parallel instances.
 *
 * <p>The P-VAL restart schedule was introduced in:<br>
