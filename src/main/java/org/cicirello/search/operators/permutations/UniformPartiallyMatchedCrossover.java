/**
 * Implementation of uniform partially matched crossover (UPMX). UPMX is a variation of partially
 * matched crossover (PMX), but whereas PMX selects a contiguous cross region similar to a two-point
 * bit-string crossover, UPMX selects a set of non-contiguous cross points similar to uniform
 * crossover for bit-strings. UPMX begins by selecting a set of random cross points, using a
 * parameter U, which is the probability that an index is a cross point. Thus, for permutation
 * length N, the expected number of cross points is U*N. UPMX then initializes the children as
 * copies of the parents, and proceeds to make a sequence of swaps within child c1 as to cause c1 at
 * the end of those swaps to contain the elements from the cross points of p2 at those indexes. And
 * similarly for the other child. Essentially, the cross points define a set of swaps that are made
 * internally within each child.
 *
 * <p>Consider as an example parent permutation p1 = [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0] and parent permutation
 * p2 = [1, 2, 0, 5, 6, 4, 7, 3]. Now consider that the random cross sites are indexes 3, 1, and 6.
 * Child c1 is initialized as a copy of p1, i.e., c1 = [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]. At index 3 in p1 is
 * element 4, and at index 3 in p2 is element 5, so UPMX swaps the 4 and the 5 within c1 to get c1 =
 * [7, 6, 4, 5, 3, 2, 1, 0]. At index 1, we find elements 6 and 2 in p1 and p2, respectively, so
 * UMPX swaps the 6 and the 2 within c1 to get c1 = [7, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 1, 0]. Finally, at index 6,
 * we find 1 and 7 in p1 and p2, respectively. Thus, UPMX swaps the 1 and 7 within c1 to get the
 * final child c1 = [1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7, 0]. In a similar way, we can derive child c2, such that c2
 * = [7, 6, 0, 4, 2, 5, 1, 3].
 *
