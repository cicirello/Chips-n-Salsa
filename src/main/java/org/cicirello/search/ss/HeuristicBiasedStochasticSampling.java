/**
 * Heuristic Biased Stochastic Sampling (HBSS) is a form of stochastic sampling search that uses a
 * constructive heuristic to bias the random decisions. In HBSS, the search generates N random
 * candidate solutions to the problem, using a problem-specific heuristic to rank the choices, and
 * then biasing each random decision in favor of choices that are preferred by the heuristic (have
 * ranks closer to 1). It evaluates each of the N candidate solutions with respect to the
 * optimization problem's cost function, and returns the best of the N candidate solutions.
 *
 * <p>Although the HBSS algorithm itself is not restricted to permutation problems, the examples
 * that follow in this documentation focus on permutations for illustrative purposes.
 *
 * <p>Let's consider an illustrative example. Consider a problem whose solution is to be represented
 * with a permutation of length L of the integers {0, 1, ..., (L-1)}. For the sake of this example,
 * let L=4. Thus, we are searching for a permutation of the integers {0, 1, 2, 3}. We will
 * iteratively build up a partial permutation containing a subset of the elements into a complete
 * permutation.
 *
 * <p>We begin with an empty partial permutation: p = []. The first iteration will select the first
 * element. To do so, we use a heuristic to evaluate each option within the context of the problem.
 * Let S be the set of elements not yet in the permutation, which in this case is initially S = {0,
 * 1, 2, 3}. Let h(p, e) be a constructive heuristic that takes as input the current partial
 * permutation p, and an element e from S under consideration for addition to p, and which produces
 * a real value as output that increases as the importance of adding e to p increases. That is,
 * higher values of the heuristic imply that the heuristic has a higher level of confidence that the
 * element e should be added next to p. For the sake of this example, consider that the heuristic
 * values are as follows: h([], 0) = 5, h([], 1) = 7, h([], 2) = 2, and h([], 3) = 1. The heuristic
 * seems to favor element 1 the most, and has element 0 as its second choice, followed by element 2
 * as its third choice, and then element 3 is last. HBSS then ranks the choices. Let r(e) be the
 * rank of element e. Thus, we have: r(0) = 2, r(1) = 1, r(2) = 3, and r(3) = 4.
 *
 * <p>Now, HBSS also uses a bias function b. We will compute b(r(e)) for each element e under
 * consideration for addition to partial permutation p. A common form of the bias function is
 * b(r(e)) = 1 / r(e)<sup>a</sup> for some exponent a. The reason for the fraction is that lower
 * ranks imply apparently better choice, but we need the bias to be higher for apparently better
 * choices. The greater your confidence is in the decision making ability of the heuristic, the
 * greater the exponent a should be. We'll use a=2 for this example. So given our heuristic values
 * from above, we have the following: b(r(0)) = 1/4 = 0.25, b(r(1)) = 1, b(r(2)) = 1/9 = 0.111, and
 * b(r(3)) = 1/16 = 0.0625.
 *
 * <p>The element that is added to the partial permutation p is then determined randomly such that
 * the probability P(e) of choosing element e is proportional to b(r(e)). Let's sum the b(r(e))
 * across the four elements. That sum is approximately 1.4235. In this example, P(0) = 0.25 / 1.4235
 * = 0.176. P(1) = 1 / 1.4235 = 0.702. P(2) = 0.111 / 1.4235 = 0.078. P(3) = 0.0625 / 1.4235 =
 * 0.044. So with rather high probability, HBSS will end up beginning the permutation with element 1
 * in this example.
 *
 * <p>For the sake of the example, let's assume that element 1 was chosen above. We now have partial
 * permutation p = [1], and the set of elements not yet added to p is S = {0, 2, 3}. We need to
 * compute h([1], e) for each of the elements e from S, determine their ranks r, and then compute
 * b(r(e)). For most problems, the heuristic values would have changed, which might cause the ranks
 * of the remaining elements also to change relative to each other. For example, if the problem was
 * the traveling salesperson, then the heuristic might be in terms of the distance from the last
 * city already in the partial permutation (favoring nearby cities). As you move from city to city,
 * which cities are nearest will change. This is why one of the inputs to the heuristic must be the
 * current partial permutation. So let's assume for the example that we recompute the heuristic and
 * get the following values: h([1], 0) = 1, h([1], 2) = 4, and h([1], 3) = 3. The corresponding
 * ranks are: r(0) = 3, r(2) = 1, and r(3) = 2. When we compute the biases, we get: b(r(0)) = 1/9 =
 * 0.111, b(r(2)) = 1, and b(r(3)) = 1/4 = 0.25. The sum of the biases is 1.361. The selection
 * probabilities are thus: P(0) = 0.111 / 1.361 = 0.082; P(2) = 1 / 1.361 = 0.735; and P(3) = 0.25 /
 * 1.361 = 0.184. There is much higher probability of selecting element 2, but for this example
 * consider that element 3 was chosen instead. Thus, p is now p = [1, 3] and S = {0, 2}.
 *
 * <p>One final decision is needed in this example. Let h([1, 3], 0) = 5, and h([1, 3], 2) = 6,
 * which means r(0) = 2 and r(2) = 1, and further that b(r(0)) = 1/4 = 0.25, and b(r(2)) = 1, which
 * sum to 1.25. The selection probabilities are then: P(0) = 0.25 / 1.25 = 0.2, and P(2) = 1 / 1.25
 * = 0.8. Let's say that element 2 was chosen, so that now we have p = [0, 3, 2]. Since only one
 * element remains, it is thus added as well to get p = [0, 3, 2, 1]. This permutation is then
 * evaluated with the optimization problem's cost function, and the entire process repeated N times
 * ultimately returning the best (lowest cost) of the N randomly sampled solutions.
 *
 * <p>To use this implementation of HBSS, you will need to implement a constructive heuristic for
 * your problem using the {@link ConstructiveHeuristic} interface. The
 * HeuristicBiasedStochasticSampling class also provides a variety of constructors enabling defining
 * the bias function in different ways. The most basic uses the approach of the above example,
 * allowing specifying the exponent, and the default is simply an exponent of 1. The most general
 * allows you to specify any arbitrary bias function using the {@link BiasFunction} interface. Make
 * sure that you remember when implementing a bias for HBSS that lower values of rank imply the
 * presumed better option.
 *
 * <p>Assuming that the length of the permutation is L, and that the runtime of the constructive
 * heuristic is O(f(L)), the runtime to construct one permutation using HBSS is O(L<sup>2</sup>
 * f(L)). If the cost, f(L), to heuristically evaluate one permutation element is simply, O(1),
 * constant time, then the cost to heuristically construct one permutation with HBSS is simply
 * O(L<sup>2</sup>).
