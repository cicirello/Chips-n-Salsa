/**
 * The Permutation in a Haystack is a family of optimization problems that can be parameterized to
 * the various types of permutation problem (e.g., absolute versus relative positioning). The
 * Permutation in a Haystack problem uses permutation distance metrics to specify search landscape
 * topology, providing an easy means of studying the behavior of search operators on a wide variety
 * of permutation landscapes.
 *
 * <p>The Permutation in a Haystack Problem, Haystack(&delta;, n), is defined as follows. Find the
 * permutation p such that, p = argmin<sub>p'</sub> &delta;(p', p<sub>n</sub>), where p<sub>n</sub>
 * = [0, 1, ..., (n-1)]. The p<sub>n</sub> is called the target permutation, and is just the
 * permutation of the first n non-negative integers in increasing order. The p<sub>n</sub> is our
 * figurative needle for which we are searching our haystack. It is also the optimal solution to the
 * problem, so in this way the search problem has a known optimal. The &delta; is a measure of the
 * distance for permutations. There are many measures of permutation distance available in the
 * literature. Some focus on exact positions of elements in the permutation, others focus on
 * relative ordering of permutation elements, others focus on element precedences, etc. In this way,
 * the choice of &delta; enables you to control the search space topology. The {@link
 * org.cicirello.permutations.distance} package includes implementations of many permutation
 * distance measures. The class includes a constructor that uses the target permutation as defined
 * above, as well as an additional constructor that enables you to specify a different target.
