/**
 * This class implements Bit Flip Mutation, the mutation operator commonly used in genetic
 * algorithms, but which can also be used with other metaheuristic search algorithms such as
 * simulated annealing to generate random neighbors.
 *
 * <p>In a bit flip mutation, each bit of the BitVector is flipped with probability M, known as the
 * mutation rate. Flipping a bit means changing it to 0 if it is currently a 1, or changing it to 1
 * if it is currently a 0. If the length of the BitVector is N, then the expected number of bits
 * flipped during a single call to the {@link #mutate} method is NM. However, there is no guarantee
 * that any bits will be flipped by a call to the {@link #mutate} method. This behavior is fine for
 * genetic algorithms, but may be less than desirable for other metaheuristics, such as those that
 * operate on a single candidate solution rather than a population of them. If you have need for a
 * mutation operator for BitVectors that guarantees that all calls to the {@link #mutate} method
 * will change the BitVector, then consider using the {@link DefiniteBitFlipMutation} class instead.
