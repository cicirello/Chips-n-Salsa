/**
 * DefiniteBitFlipMutation implements a variation of Bit Flip Mutation. The form of bit flip
 * mutation commonly used in genetic algorithms (and implemented in the class {@link
 * BitFlipMutation}) is not guaranteed to change any bits during a mutation. For a metaheuristic
 * that operates on a single solution rather than a population of solutions, such as simulated
 * annealing and hill climbers, where we might use a mutation operator to generate neighbors, then
 * we will want mutation to always make some change. The DefiniteBitFlipMutation class is a
 * variation of the classic bit flip that guarantees at least 1 bit will be flipped during each
 * invocation of the mutation operator.
 *
 * <p>Genetic Algorithm style Bit Flip Mutation: In a bit flip mutation, each bit is flipped with
 * probability M, known as the mutation rate. Flipping a bit means changing it to 0 if it is
 * currently a 1, or changing it to 1 if it is currently a 0. If the length of the BitVector is N,
 * then the expected number of bits flipped during a single mutation operation is NM. However, there
 * is no guarantee that any bits will be flipped during a genetic algorithm style bit flip mutation.
 * This behavior is fine for genetic algorithms, but may be less than desirable for other
 * metaheuristics, such as those that operate on a single candidate solution rather than a
 * population of them.
 *
 * <p>Definite Bit Flip Mutation: This class does not implement the genetic algorithm style bit flip
 * mutation. Instead, it implements a variation of it that we call Definite Bit Flip, which
 * guarantees that at least 1 bit will be flipped during a call to the {@link #mutate} method.
 * Instead of a mutation parameter, the Definite Bit Flip Mutation uses a parameter B which is an
 * upper bound on the number of bits that can be flipped during a single call to the {@link #mutate}
 * method. When the {@link #mutate} method is called, the mutation operator picks a number of bits
 * to flip, f, uniformly at random from the interval [1, B]. It then flips f randomly selected bits,
 * where all combinations of f bits are equally likely. The expected number of bits flipped during a
 * single call to the {@link #mutate} method is (1+B)/2.
