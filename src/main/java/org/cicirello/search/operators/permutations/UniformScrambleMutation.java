/**
 * This class implements a scramble mutation on permutations, where one mutation consists in
 * randomizing the order of a non-contiguous subset of the permutation elements. It is controlled by
 * a parameter U, which is the probability that an element is included in the scramble. On average,
 * you can expect U*n elements to be randomized, where n is the length of the permutation.
 *
 * <p>The worst case runtime of the {@link #mutate(Permutation) mutate} method is O(n), and the
 * average case is O(U*n), where n is the length of the permutation.
