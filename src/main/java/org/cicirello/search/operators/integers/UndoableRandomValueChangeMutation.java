/**
 * This mutation operator (supporting the undo operation) is for integer valued representations, and
 * replaces an integer value with a different random integer value from the domain. The domain is
 * specified with an interval: [a, b]. The parameter p specifies the probability of mutating an
 * integer. E.g., if the {@link IntegerValued} object undergoing mutation has n integers, then on
 * average the {@link #mutate} method will mutate k=n*p of those integers. The k integers chosen for
 * mutation are chosen uniformly at random. For each of those k integers, the new value is chosen
 * uniformly at random from [a, b] but excluding its current value. For example, let [a, b]=[0,4],
 * and consider mutating an integer v whose value is currently v=3. The new value for v will be
 * chosen uniformly at random from the set {0, 1, 2, 4}. Note that when a=0 and b=1, this mutation
 * operator becomes equivalent to the traditional bit-flip mutation commonly used in genetic
 * algorithms when solutions are represented as bit strings, although use of this class and the
 * {@link IntegerValued} class for that purpose is not recommended as there are much more efficient
 * ways of representing strings of bits (e.g., using bit level operators).
 *
 * @param <T> The specific IntegerValued type.
