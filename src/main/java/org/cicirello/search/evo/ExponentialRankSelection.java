/**
 * This class implements exponential rank selection. Exponential rank selection begins be
 * determining the rank of each population member, where the least fit member of the population has
 * rank 1, and the most fit member of the population has rank N, where the population size is N.
 * During selection, the population member with rank r is chosen randomly with probability
 * proportional to: c<sup>N-r</sup>. The c is a real-valued parameter that must be in the interval
 * (0, 1). The most-fit member of the population will be chosen with probability proportional to 1,
 * while the least-fit will be chosen with probability proportional to c<sup>N-1</sup>. In the limit
 * as c approaches 1, exponential selection converges to a uniform random selection method. Whereas
 * in the limit as c approaches 0, exponential selection converges upon a degenerate selection
 * method that chooses an entire population of copies of the single most-fit population member. The
 * lower the value of c, the faster the degree of exponential decline in weight given to lower
 * ranked population members.
 *
 * <p>The runtime to select M population members from a population of size N is O(N lg N + M lg N).
