/**
 * This class provides a convenient mechanism for transforming optimization cost values to fitness
 * values. Most of the algorithms in the library require a cost function to minimize through a class
 * that implements either {@link OptimizationProblem} or {@link IntegerCostOptimizationProblem}.
 * However, the evolutionary algorithms in the library require a fitness function such that higher
 * fitness implies better solution. Furthermore, some selection operators further assume that
 * fitness values are positive, such as {@link FitnessProportionalSelection} and {@link
 * StochasticUniversalSampling}.
 *
 * <p>This class transforms the cost of solution s to fitness to meet these requirements with the
 * following transformation: fitness(s) = c / (c + problem.cost(s) - problem.minCost()), where c is
 * a positive constant, which defaults to 1.0 (see constructors). The problem.cost(s) and
 * problem.minCost() refer to the methods by those names in the {@link OptimizationProblem} and
 * {@link IntegerCostOptimizationProblem} classes. Note that the adjustment by problem.minCost()
 * ensures that fitness will be positive even if costs can be negative.
 *
 * <p>Note that the problem's implementation of minCost must return a finite lower bound for the
 * cost function (which is assumed to be correct), otherwise the constructors of this class will
 * throw an {@link IllegalArgumentException}.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of object under optimization.
