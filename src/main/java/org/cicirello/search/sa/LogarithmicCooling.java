/**
 * This class implements logarithmic cooling, a classic annealing schedule. This annealing schedule
 * is of theoretical interest, but in general is not practical. The classic convergence results for
 * simulated annealing depend upon logarithmic cooling. In particular, with logarithmic cooling, if
 * the temperature begins sufficiently high, then in the limit simulated annealing converges to the
 * globally optimal solution. However, the temperature cools so slowly with logarithmic cooling that
 * for any practical search length, the search remains essentially a random walk, and does not come
 * anywhere close to the limit behavior. We have included the logarithmic cooling schedule in the
 * library in the interests of being complete.
 *
 * <p>In logarithmic cooling, the k-th temperature is defined as: t<sub>k</sub> = c / ln(k + d),
 * where c and d are constants. The value of c should be set based on cost differences between
 * random neighbors, and d is usually set equal to 1. In our case, since we start k at 0, a value of
 * d=1 would lead to a division by 0. Additionally, to simplify initialization for the programmer
 * using this annealing schedule, our implementation sets d=e (i.e., to the base of the natural
 * logarithm). Logarithms are so slow growing that small differences in the value of d don't change
 * the behavior of the schedule in any significant way. When k=0, the denominator is thus ln(e)=1.
 * Thus, c can be set to the desired initial temperature. Therefore, our implementation redefines
 * the cooling schedule as: t<sub>k</sub> = t<sub>0</sub> / ln(k + e), where e is the base of the
 * natural logarithm.
