/**
 * This class implements the Cycle(&alpha;) form of cycle mutation on permutations, where one
 * mutation generates a random permutation cycle. Given the original parent permutation and its
 * mutant, a permutation cycle can be defined as follows. Imagine a graph with n vertexes, where n
 * is the permutation length. Now consider that for each index i, we define an edge in that graph
 * between vertex parent[i] and vertex mutant[i]. A permutation cycle consists of all of the
 * elements from one of the cycles in that graph. The length of a cycle is the number of elements in
 * it. Consider an example permutation, p1 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], and another permutation, p2 = [0, 3,
 * 2, 1, 4]. This pair of permutations has a 2-cycle (i.e., a cycle of length 2) consisting of
 * elements 1 and 3. Consider a second example, p1 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], and p2 = [0, 4, 2, 1, 3]. This
 * example has a 3-cycle consisting of elements 1, 3, and 4. Notice that position 1 has elements 1
 * and 4, position 4 has elements 4 and 3, and position 3 has elements 3 and 1, so in the
 * hypothetical graph described above, there would be edges from 1 to 4, 4 to 3, and 3 to 1, a cycle
 * of length 3.
 *
 * <p>The Cycle(&alpha;) version of cycle mutation chooses the cycle size randomly from {2, 3, ...,
 * n} where cycle length k is chosen with probability proportional to &alpha;<sup>k-2</sup>. It then
 * generates a random permutation cycle of length k. The combination of k elements is chosen
 * uniformly at random from all possible combinations of k elements. Note that a 2-cycle is simply a
 * swap.
 *
 * <p>The worst case runtime of a single call to the {@link #mutate(Permutation) mutate} method is
 * O(n), which occurs when the randomly chosen cycle length is n. However, this is a very low
 * probability event. Lower cycle lengths are given significantly higher probability. The average
 * case runtime of a single call to the {@link #mutate(Permutation) mutate} method is O(min(n,
 * ((2-&alpha;)/(1-&alpha;))<sup>2</sup>)). Thus, provided &alpha; is not close to 1, the average
 * runtime is a constant depending upon the value of &alpha;.
 *
