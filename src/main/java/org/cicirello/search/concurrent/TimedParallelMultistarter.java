/**
 * This class is used for implementing parallel multistart metaheuristics. It can be used to restart
 * any class that implements the {@link Metaheuristic} interface. A multistart metaheuristic returns
 * the best result from among all of the restarts. In the case of a parallel multistart
 * metaheuristic, the search returns the best result from among all restarts across all threads.
 *
 * <p>This parallel multistarter enables specifying the run length in terms of time, rather than by
 * number of restarts. It then executes as many restarts as that length of time allows. This may be
 * more desirable for multiple use cases. First, if the run lengths can vary from one restart to
 * another, each parallel instance of the search may have rather different run times if we were to
 * specify the number of times to restart. This would lead to some threads sitting idle. Second, if
 * we were executing different metaheuristics in different threads, then again one or more threads
 * may complete early sitting idle if we were to specify number of times to restart. Third, a
 * similar phenomena can result if we were executing the same metaheuristic (e.g., simulated
 * annealing) but where each parallel instance was using a different mutation operator. Finally, if
 * we know how much time we can afford to search, we don't need a priori know the length of time
 * required by a restart.
 *
 * <p>There are several constructors enabling different ways to configure the search. You can
 * initialize the search with a combination of a {@link Metaheuristic} and number of threads along
 * with either a {@link RestartSchedule} for the purpose of specifying run lengths for the restarts,
 * or a run length if all runs are to be of the same length. You can also initialize the search with
 * a Collection of {@link RestartSchedule} objects, one for each thread (with number of threads
 * implied by size of Collection. Or you can initialize the search with a Collection of {@link
 * Metaheuristic} objects and a Collection of {@link RestartSchedule} objects (both Collections of
 * the same size). You can also initialize the search with a {@link Multistarter} configured with
 * your restart schedule, along with the number of threads, or a Collection of {@link Multistarter}
 * objects.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of object being optimized.
