### Other


## [6.4.0] - 2023-07-28

### Added
* Added configurable source of randomness (#638). 
* Added Position Based Crossover (PBX), a crossover operator for permutations (#642).
* New constructors in BitVector class enabling specifying source of randomness for random BitVectors (#638).

### Dependencies
* Bump jpt from 5.0.4 to 5.1.0
* Bump rho-mu from 3.1.0 to 3.1.1


## [6.3.0] - 2023-05-15

### Added
* NaiveGenerationalEvolutionaryAlgorithm: This is the typical implementation of a generational EA. It is temporarily added to the library in this release for a specific research purpose. You should instead use the existing GenerationalEvolutionaryAlgorithm class, which is logically and statistically equivalent, as well as highly optimized.

### Changed
* Refactored and optimized:
  * NonWrappingOrderCrossover
  * OrderCrossover
  * OrderCrossoverTwo
  * PartiallyMatchedCrossover
  * TwoChangeMutation
  * UniformOrderBasedCrossover
  * UniformPartiallyMatchedCrossover

### Deprecated
* The new NaiveGenerationalEvolutionaryAlgorithm class is deprecated upon introduction. It is temporarily added to the library in this release for a specific research purpose. Once that research purpose is served, it will be removed from the library with no further notice. That future removal will not be considered a breaking change due to the prominent notice in the class's documentation upon introduction. You should instead use the existing GenerationalEvolutionaryAlgorithm class, which is logically and statistically equivalent, but is highly optimized.

## [4.0.0] - 2022-01-05

### CONTAINS BREAKING CHANGES
This release contains breaking changes. See the Removed list below for details. The most significant
breaking changes relate to functionality initially introduced in v3.1.0, released on 12/21/2021, and 
thus likely affects very few users. Other breaking changes relate to removal of previously deprecated
methods.

### Added
* Added GenerationalMutationOnlyEvolutionaryAlgorithm, moving the mutation-only EA
  functionality into this new class from the existing GenerationalEvolutionaryAlgorithm
  class.
* Added GenerationalNANDOperatorsEvolutionaryAlgorithm, moving the EA
  functionality related to mutually-exclusive genetic operators (i.e., generation variation where
  each child is result of either mutation, or crossover, or identical copy of a parent, but never
  result of both mutation and crossover) into this new class from the existing 
  GenerationalEvolutionaryAlgorithm class.
* Enhanced all of the following Evolutionary Algorithm and Genetic Algorithm classes with the option to use elitism:
  * GenerationalEvolutionaryAlgorithm
  * GenerationalMutationOnlyEvolutionaryAlgorithm
  * GenerationalNANDOperatorsEvolutionaryAlgorithm
  * GeneticAlgorithm
  * MutationOnlyGeneticAlgorithm
* Crossover operators for IntegerVector and BoundedIntegerVector classes, including:
  * Single-point crossover
  * Two-point crossover
  * K-point crossover
  * Uniform crossover
* Crossover operators for RealVector and BoundedRealVector classes, including:
  * Single-point crossover
  * Two-point crossover
  * K-point crossover
  * Uniform crossover
* Enhancements to IntegerVector and BoundedIntegerVector, including:
  * IntegerVector.exchange method which exchanges a subsequence between two IntegerVectors.
  * BoundedIntegerVector.sameBounds method which checks if two bounded integer vectors are
    subject to the same min and max values.
* Enhancements to RealVector and BoundedRealVector, including:
  * RealVector.exchange method which exchanges a subsequence between two RealVectors.
  * BoundedRealVector.sameBounds method which checks if two bounded real vectors are
    subject to the same min and max values.
* Added constructors to TSP (traveling salesperson problem) classes to enable specifying
  problem instance from arrays of x and y coordinates.

### Changed
* Refactored evolutionary algorithm classes to improve maintainability, and ease
  integration of planned future functionality.
* Refactored ProgressTracker.update(SolutionCostPair) to simplify logic.

### Removed
* Removed all mutation-only EA functionality from the GenerationalEvolutionaryAlgorithm,
  moving that functionality into the new GenerationalMutationOnlyEvolutionaryAlgorithm. This
  was done for maintainability. It is a breaking-change, although it should affect minimal
  users as the GenerationalEvolutionaryAlgorithm was just introduced in v3.1.0. For those using it
  simply use the new GenerationalMutationOnlyEvolutionaryAlgorithm class where you will
  find all the same constructors and methods necessary for mutation-only EAs.
* Removed all mutually-exclusive genetic operator functionality from the GenerationalEvolutionaryAlgorithm,
  moving that functionality into the new GenerationalNANDOperatorsEvolutionaryAlgorithm. This
  was done for maintainability. It is a breaking-change, although it should affect minimal
  users as the GenerationalEvolutionaryAlgorithm was just introduced in v3.1.0. For those using it
  simply use the new GenerationalNANDOperatorsEvolutionaryAlgorithm class where you will
  find that functionality.
* All methods/constructors that were previously deprecated in earlier releases have 
  now been removed, including:
  * The following deprecated methods of the ProgressTracker class have been removed:
    * `update(int, T)` in favor of using `update(int, T, boolean)`.
    * `update(double, T)` in favor of using `update(double, T, boolean)`.
    * `setFoundBest()` in favor of using either `update(int, T, boolean)` 
      or `update(double, T, boolean)`.
  * The following deprecated constructors of the SolutionCostPair class have been removed:
    * `SolutionCostPair(T, int)` in favor of using `SolutionCostPair(T, int, boolean)`
    * `SolutionCostPair(T, double)` in favor of using `SolutionCostPair(T, double, boolean)`


## [3.1.0] - 2021-12-21

  * A new method to exchange a sequence of bits between two BitVectors.
  * A new method to exchange a selection of bits, specified with a bit mask, between two BitVectors.
  * A new constructor, BitVector(length, p), that generates random bit masks given probability p of a 1-bit.
* Generational evolutionary algorithms, including the following features and functionality:

    are evolving, and which supports the following EA variations:
    * Standard generational model, parents replaced by children, crossover and mutation.
    * Generational with mutation-only (no crossover).
    * Generational, parents replaced by children, with mutually exclusive crossover and mutation (i.e.,
      no child is result of both crossover and mutation).

    when optimizing BitVectors, including:
    * GeneticAlgorithm: a standard generational GA with bit flip mutation, and choice of crossover operator

    * SimpleGeneticAlgorithm: a generational GA with bit flip mutation, single-point crossover, and fitness proportional
      selection.

    * CrossoverOperator interface for defining custom crossover operators.
    * Support for hybrid crossover operators (e.g., picking randomly from set of crossover operators).
  * Crossover operators for BitVectors, including:
    * Single-point crossover
    * Two-point crossover
    * K-point crossover
    * Uniform crossover
  * The following selection operators:
    * FitnessProportionalSelection
    * StochasticUniversalSampling
    * TournamentSelection
    * TruncationSelection
    * RandomSelection
    * BiasedFitnessProportionalSelection, which is fitness proportional selection but which
      enables transforming the fitness values by a bias function.
    * BiasedStochasticUniversalSampling, which is stochastic universal sampling but which
      enables transforming the fitness values by a bias function.
    * ShiftedFitnessProportionalSelection, which is a variation of FitnessProportionalSelection
      that uses transformed fitness values that are shifted so that the minimum is equal to 1,
      enabling safe use with negative fitness values.
    * ShiftedStochasticUniversalSampling, which is a variation of StochasticUniversalSampling
      that uses transformed fitness values that are shifted so that the minimum is equal to 1,
      enabling safe use with negative fitness values.

      that uses transformed fitness values that are shifted so that the minimum is equal to 1,
      enabling safe use with negative fitness values.
  * Classes to transform cost values to fitness values:
    * InverseCostFitnessFunction: Transforms optimization cost functions to fitnesses with a
      division.
    * NegativeCostFitnessFunction: Transforms cost to fitness with fitness(s)=-cost(s).

### CI/CD
* Updated CI/CD workflow to comment on PRs with the coverage and branches coverage percentages.


## [3.0.0] - 2021-10-25

### Added
* Implementation of the Traveling Salesperson Problem (class TSP), with the following features:
  * Generates random instances with cities distributed uniformly at random within a square.
  * Defaults to Euclidean distance, but also supports specifying a function for edge distance.
  * Two variations with a precomputed matrix of edge costs: floating-point costs, and integer costs, 
    where the integer cost version by default rounds each edge cost to nearest int, but which can be 
    customized. These use quadratic memory.
  * Two variations where edge costs are computed as needed: floating-point costs, and integer costs, 
    where the integer cost version by default rounds each edge cost to nearest int, but which can be 
    customized. These use linear memory.

### Changed
* Beginning with release 3.0.0, the minimum supported Java version is now Java 11+.
* The randomization utilities for generating Gaussian-distributed random numbers, previously 
  contained in the package org.cicirello.math.rand has been moved to a new 
  library [&rho;&mu;](https://rho-mu.cicirello.org/), which is a transitive dependency (via 
  our dependency on [JPT](https://github.com/cicirello/JavaPermutationTools)).
* Refactored GaussianMutation to improve maintainability by eliminating dependence upon a 
  specific algorithm for generating Gaussian distributed random numbers.
* The library now uses Java modules, providing the module `org.cicirello.chips_n_salsa`, which
  includes the package `org.cicirello.search` and all of its very many subpackages.
  * The required dependent module `org.cicirello.jpt` is declared with `requires transitive`
    because the `Permutation` class from one of the packages of that module is a parameter
	and/or returned by a variety of methods such as operators that manipulate permutations.
	As a consequence, projects that include Chips-n-Salsa as a dependency will also include JPT
	and its dependencies. User's dependency manager should handle this.
* Changed the default annealing schedule in the SimulatedAnnealing class to the Self-Tuning Lam
  adaptive schedule of Cicirello (2021), which is implemented in class SelfTuningLam.

### Other
* Reorganized directory hierarchy to the Maven default (we had been using a custom directory
  hierarchy for quite some time from before we switched to Maven).
  

## [2.13.0] - 2021-09-16

### Added
* The Self-Tuning Lam annealing schedule (class SelfTuningLam), as described by the
  paper: Vincent A. Cicirello. 2021. Self-Tuning Lam Annealing: Learning Hyperparameters 
  While Problem Solving. Applied Sciences, 11(21), Article 9828 (November 2021). https://doi.org/10.3390/app11219828.
* Implementation of Forrester et al (2008) continuous function optimization problem.

  equal to theoretical minimum cost for problem.


## [2.12.0] - 2021-7-28

### Added
* Implementations of various Royal Road problems (optimization problems on bit vectors).
  * RoyalRoad class which implements Mitchell et al's original two variations (with
    and without stepping stones) of the Royal Road problem, but generalized to BitVectors
    of any length as well as other block sizes (Mitchell et al's original problem was on
    bit vectors of length 64 with 8-bit blocks).
  * HollandRoyalRoad class implements Holland's Royal Road function.

### Changed
* Completely redesigned the website for the library, including
  redesigning with AMP to accelerate mobile browsing.
* Upgraded JPT dependency to JPT 2.6.1.


## [2.11.1] - 2021-5-13

### Changed
* Code improvements based on report from initial run of MuseDev's 
  static code analysis tool (non-functional changes to improve code).

### Fixed
* Fixed null pointer bug in stochastic sampling implementations for the case when
  the given heuristic doesn't use an incremental evaluation.


## [2.11.0] - 2021-5-11

### Added
* New mutation operators for permutations:
    * UniformScrambleMutation: Like ScrambleMutation, but scrambled elements
      are not necessarily contiguous.
    * UndoableUniformScrambleMutation: Exactly like UniformScrambleMutation (see above),
      but with support for the undo method of the UndoableMutationOperator interface.
    * TwoChangeMutation: Mutation operator on permutations that is the equivalent of
      the classic two change operator, assuming that the permutation represents a cyclic
      sequence of edges.
    * ThreeOptMutation: Mutation operator on permutations that is the equivalent of
      the classic 3-Opt operator, which is a combination of two-changes and three-changes,
      assuming that the permutation represents a cyclic sequence of edges.
    * CycleMutation: Generates a random permutation cycle.

### Changed
* Updated dependency to JPT, v2.6.0.
* Minor optimization to UndoableScrambleMutation, utilizing the JPT updates.

### CI/CD

      metaheuristic that supports the reoptimize method, or multiple such metaheuristics, 
      in parallel using multiple threads.
* Additional artificial search landscapes, including:
    * OneMaxAckley class implements the original version of the One Max
      problem as described by Ackley (1985), whereas the existing OneMax 
      class in the library implements a variation. Ackley defined the problem
      as maximize 10 * number of one bits.
    * Plateaus class implements the Plateaus problem, originally described by Ackley (1987),
      and is an optimization problem over the space of bit strings, characterized by large
      flat areas.

      a base class.
    * Refactored ParallelReoptimizableMultistarter class to utilize the 
      new ParallelReoptimizableMetaheuristic as its super class.

## [2.9.0] - 2021-3-20

### Added
* Added an implementation of the TwoMax problem.
* Added an implementation of a variation of the TwoMax problem, but
  with two global optima, unlike the original version which has one 
  global and one sub-optimal local optima.
* Added an implementation of Ackley's Trap function, an artificial
  search landscape with one global optima, and one sub-optimal local
  optima, where most of the search space is within the attraction basin 
  of the local optima.
* Added an implementation of Ackley's Porcupine function, an artificial
  search landscape with one global optima, and an exponential number of
  local optima, a very rugged landscape.


## [2.8.0] - 2021-3-5

### Added
* Added AcceptanceTracker, which provides a mechanism for extracting 
  information about the behavior of an annealing schedule across a
  set of runs of simulated annealing.
* Added CostFunctionScaler, which enables scaling the cost function of
  an optimization problem by a positive constant, such as if you want to
  explore the effects of the range of a cost function on a stochastic local
  search algorithm by scaling a cost function with a known range.
* Added IntegerCostFunctionScaler, which enables scaling the cost function of
  an optimization problem by a positive constant, such as if you want to
  explore the effects of the range of a cost function on a stochastic local
  search algorithm by scaling a cost function with a known range. This class
  is just like CostFunctionScaler but for problems with integer costs.


## [2.7.0] - 2021-2-25

### Added
* Added HybridConstructiveHeuristic, which provides the ability
  to use multiple heuristics with a stochastic sampling search,
  where a heuristic is chosen from a set of constructive heuristics
  at the start of each iteration of the stochastic sampler and used
  for all decisions made during that iteration. The class supports the
  following strategies for selecting the next heuristic:
    * Heuristic uniformly at random from among the available heuristics.
    * Heuristic chosen using a round robin strategy that systematically cycles
      over the heuristics.
    * Heuristic chosen via a weighted random selection process.
* Added versions of a few constructive heuristics for 
  scheduling problems that precompute heuristic values 
  upon construction of the heuristic. Many of the scheduling 
  heuristic implementations already do this, where it is 
  possible to do so, provided the memory and time requirements 
  for precomputing heuristic values is linear in the number 
  of jobs. Some heuristics that consider setup times, however, 
  need quadratic memory if the heuristic is precomputed prior 
  to running the search. The existing implementations of these 
  compute the heuristic as it is needed during the search, 
  which means for a stochastic sampler with many iterations 
  that the same heuristic values will be computed repeatedly. 
  We've added versions of these that precompute the heuristic 
  values so that if your problem is small enough to afford the 
  quadratic memory, and if you will be running enough iterations 
  of the stochastic sampler to afford the quadratic time of 
  this precomputation step, then you can choose to use a 
  precomputed version.
    * A scheduling heuristic, SmallestSetupPrecompute, which is 
      a version of SmallestSetup, but which precomputes a table 
      of heuristic values to avoid recomputing the same heuristic 
      values repeatedly across multiple iterations of a stochastic 
      sampling search.
    * A scheduling heuristic, ShortestProcessingPlusSetupTimePrecompute, which is 
      a version of ShortestProcessingPlusSetupTime, but which precomputes a table 
      of heuristic values to avoid recomputing the same heuristic 
      values repeatedly across multiple iterations of a stochastic 
      sampling search.
    * A scheduling heuristic, WeightedShortestProcessingPlusSetupTimePrecompute, which is 
      a version of WeightedShortestProcessingPlusSetupTime, but which precomputes a table 
      of heuristic values to avoid recomputing the same heuristic 
      values repeatedly across multiple iterations of a stochastic 
      sampling search.

### Changed
* Dependency updated to JPT v2.4.0.


## [2.6.0] - 2021-1-25

### Added
* A factory method, ConstantRestartSchedule.createRestartSchedules, for creating multiple restart schedules.
* Factory methods, VariableAnnealingLength.createRestartSchedules, for creating multiple restart schedules.

### Changed
* Refactored TimedParallelMultistarter and TimedParallelReoptimizableMultistarter to eliminate redundancy in common with these two classes.
* Refactored ParallelMultistarter and ParallelReoptimizableMultistarter to eliminate redundancy in common with these two classes.
* Eliminated code redundancy between ParallelReoptimizableMultistarter and TimedParallelReoptimizableMultistarter.

### Removed
* Javadoc's zipped versions of the api doc search index (and added to gitignore). The search feature on the API website will still be functional as it uses the unzipped versions as a fallback. The web server should compress these anyway. From Java 15 onward, they eliminated the generation of the zipped versions all together. We're removing them here since the api website is hosted from GitHub Pages, and git detects these as changed every time javadoc runs even if the index has not actually changed, and binary files are not efficiently stored in git.

### Fixed

to incompatible interface changes within the org.cicirello.search.ss package. Code 
that doesn't depend upon any of the stochastic sampling search algorithm 
implementations should be unaffected by these changes, and in those cases should 
be safe to simply upgrade to this new version without need to change anything in 
dependent code.

### Changed
* ConstructiveHeuristic and IncrementalEvaluation now have a type parameter.
* ValueBiasedStochasticSampling, HeuristicBiasedStochasticSampling, and AcceptanceBandSampling also now have a type parameter.
* All of the scheduling heuristics were modified based on interface changes.
* Renamed ConstructiveHeuristic.completePermutationLength to ConstructiveHeuristic.completeLength to be more general.

## [1.0.0]
### First public release
Chips-n-Salsa is a Java library of customizable, hybridizable, iterative, parallel, stochastic, and self-adaptive local search algorithms. The library includes implementations of several stochastic local search algorithms, including simulated annealing, hill climbers, as well as constructive search algorithms such as stochastic sampling. The library most extensively supports simulated annealing. It includes several classes for representing solutions to a variety of optimization problems. For example, the library includes a BitVector class that implements vectors of bits, as well as classes for representing solutions to problems where we are searching for an optimal vector of integers or reals. For each of the built-in representations, the library provides the most common mutation operators for generating random neighbors of candidate solutions. Additionally, the library provides extensive support for permutation optimization problems, including implementations of many different mutation operators for permutations, and utilizing the efficiently implemented Permutation class of the JavaPermutationTools (JPT) library.

Chips-n-Salsa is customizable, making extensive use of Java's generic types, enabling using the library to optimize other types of representations beyond what is provided in the library. It is hybridizable, providing support for integrating multiple forms of local search (e.g., using a hill climber on a solution generated by simulated annealing), creating hybrid mutation operators (e.g., local search using multiple mutation operators), as well as support for running more than one type of search for the same problem concurrently using multiple threads as a form of algorithm portfolio. Chips-n-Salsa is iterative, with support for multistart metaheuristics, including implementations of several restart schedules for varying the run lengths across the restarts. It also supports parallel execution of multiple instances of the same, or different, stochastic local search algorithms for an instance of a problem to accelerate the search process. The library supports self-adaptive search in a variety of ways, such as including implementations of adaptive annealing schedules for simulated annealing, such as the Modified Lam schedule, implementations of the simpler annealing schedules but which self-tune the initial temperature and other parameters, and restart schedules that adapt to run length.
