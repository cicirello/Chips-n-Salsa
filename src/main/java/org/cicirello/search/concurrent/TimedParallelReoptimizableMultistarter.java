/**
 * This class is used for implementing parallel multistart metaheuristics. It can be used to restart
 * any class that implements the {@link ReoptimizableMetaheuristic} interface. A multistart
 * metaheuristic returns the best result from among all of the restarts. In the case of a parallel
 * multistart metaheuristic, the search returns the best result from among all restarts across all
 * threads.
 *
 * <p>This parallel multistarter enables specifying the run length in terms of time, rather than by
 * number of restarts. It then executes as many restarts as that length of time allows. This may be
 * more desirable for multiple use cases. First, if the run lengths can vary from one restart to
 * another, each parallel instance of the search may have rather different run times if we were to
 * specify the number of times to restart. This would lead to some threads sitting idle. Second, if
 * we were executing different metaheuristics in different threads, then again one or more threads
 * may complete early sitting idle if we were to specify number of times to restart. Third, a
 * similar phenomena can result if we were executing the same metaheuristic (e.g., simulated
 * annealing) but where each parallel instance was using a different mutation operator. Finally, if
 * we know how much time we can afford to search, we don't need a priori know the length of time
 * required by a restart.
 *
 * <p>There are several constructors enabling different ways to configure the search. You can
 * initialize the search with a combination of a {@link ReoptimizableMetaheuristic} and number of
 * threads along with either a {@link RestartSchedule} for the purpose of specifying run lengths for
 * the restarts, or a run length if all runs are to be of the same length. You can also initialize
 * the search with a Collection of {@link RestartSchedule} objects, one for each thread (with number
 * of threads implied by size of Collection. Or you can initialize the search with a Collection of
 * {@link ReoptimizableMetaheuristic} objects and a Collection of {@link RestartSchedule} objects
 * (both Collections of the same size). You can also initialize the search with a {@link
 * ReoptimizableMultistarter} configured with your restart schedule, along with the number of
 * threads, or a Collection of {@link ReoptimizableMultistarter} objects.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of object being optimized.
