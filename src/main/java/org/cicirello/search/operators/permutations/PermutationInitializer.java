/**
 * <p>The PermutationInitializer provides metaheuristic implementations, such
 * as of simulated annealing, etc, with a way to generate random initial solutions
 * to a problem, as well as a way to make copies of current solution configurations.
 * Since it implements the {@link Initializer} interface, which relies on
 * generics, such implementations of search algorithms such as simulated annealing,
 * etc, do not need to know the representation of solutions.</p>
 *
 * <p>This initializer generates permutations uniformly at random from
 * among the space of permutations.  This is the typical case for many 
 * metaheuristics (e.g., hill climbers and simulated annealers often 
 * begin at a random solution).</p>
