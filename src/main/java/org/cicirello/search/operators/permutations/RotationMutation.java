/**
 * This class implements a rotation mutation on permutations, where one mutation consists in a
 * random circular rotation of the permutation. The number of positions to rotate the permutation is
 * uniformly at random from among the n-1 possible rotations, where the length of the permutation is
 * n. The runtime of both the {@link #mutate(Permutation) mutate} and {@link #undo(Permutation)
 * undo} methods is O(n).
 *
 * <p>Unlike the other mutation operators of the Chips-n-Salsa library, it is not possible to
 * transform one permutation to <b>any</b> other simply via some sequence of mutations. Thus,
 * RotationMutation is unlikely to be effective as the only mutation operator. The intention of the
 * RotationMutation is for it to be used in combination with other mutation operators.
