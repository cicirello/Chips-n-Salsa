/**
 * This class implements an evolutionary algorithm (EA) with a generational model, such as is
 * commonly used in genetic algorithms, where a population of children are formed by applying
 * mutation to members of the parent population, and where the children replace the parents in the
 * next generation. The EA implemented by this class does not use crossover.
 *
 * <p>The mutation and selection operators are completely configurable by passing instances of
 * classes that implement the {@link MutationOperator}, and {@link SelectionOperator} classes to one
 * of the constructors. The EA implemented by this class can also be configured to use elitism, if
 * desired, such that a specified number of the best solutions in the population survive the
 * generation unaltered.
 *
 * <p>See the {@link GenerationalEvolutionaryAlgorithm} class for a generational EA with both
 * crossover and mutation, with the common genetic algorithm style generation, such that the next
 * generation is formed from children that replace the parents, and such that children can be the
 * result of crossover alone, mutation alone, both crossover and mutation, or simply identical
 * copies of parents. The library also includes a variation of this generation structure in the
 * class {@link GenerationalEvolutionaryAlgorithmMutuallyExclusiveOperators}, where crossover and
 * mutation are treated as mutually exclusive operators such that a child in a generation may be the
 * result of crossover, or mutation, or an identical copy, but never the result of both crossover
 * and mutation.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of object under optimization.
