/**
 * This class implements a mapping between Permutation problems and BitVector problems, enabling
 * using {@link BitVector BitVector} search operators to solve problems defined over the space of
 * {@link Permutation Permutation} objects. It can also be used as an {@link Initializer} of
 * BitVectors by search algorithms to ensure that the search is using BitVectors of the appropriate
 * length to represent permutations of the desired length for the problem you are solving. In fact,
 * to ensure that your search is using the correct bit length, you should use this as your
 * Initializer.
 *
 * <p>The mapping uses a classic transformation from vector of bits to a permutation of the N
 * integers from 0 to N-1 that works as follows. Consider a list of integers L initially containing
 * the N integers in sorted order: L = [0, 1, 2, ..., N-1]. The list L is circular, such that any
 * integer is an index into L. For example, if L is of length 5, indexes 0, 5, 10, etc all refer to
 * the element in position 0. Likewise, indexes 1, 6, 11, etc all refer to the element in position
 * 1, and so forth. The bit vector must be length: (N - 1) ceiling(lg N). Each contiguous group of
 * ceiling(lg N) bits is treated as an index into L. There are N-1 such indexes available based on
 * the bit vector length. Each such index is used to select an element from L, add it to the next
 * available position of an initially empty permutation P, and remove it from L. After N-1 such
 * operations, there will be one element left in L, which is then added to the end. The {@link
 * #toPermutation toPermutation(BitVector)} method implements this transformation.
 *
 * <p>Here is an example. Consider a very small permutation length N = 6. For this length
 * permutation, the bit vector must be (6 - 1) ceiling(lg 6) = 5 * 3 = 15 bits in length. Let's
 * consider the transformation from the bit vector 111110001010100.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>L is initially L = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and P is initially P = [].
 *   <li>The first 3 bits, 111, is 7 in decimal, and 7 mod 6 = 1. L[1]=1, so we remove the 1 from L
 *       and add it to the end of P. This leads to L = [0, 2, 3, 4, 5], and P is P = [1].
 *   <li>The next 3 bits, 110, is 6 in decimal, and 6 mod 5 = 1. L[1]=2, so we remove the 2 from L
 *       and add it to the end of P. This leads to L = [0, 3, 4, 5], and P is P = [1, 2].
 *   <li>The next 3 bits, 001, is 1 in decimal, and 1 mod 4 = 1. L[1]=3, so we remove the 3 from L
 *       and add it to the end of P. This leads to L = [0, 4, 5], and P is P = [1, 2, 3].
 *   <li>The next 3 bits, 010, is 2 in decimal, and 2 mod 3 = 2. L[2]=5, so we remove the 5 from L
 *       and add it to the end of P. This leads to L = [0, 4], and P is P = [1, 2, 3, 5].
 *   <li>The last 3 bits, 100, is 4 in decimal, and 4 mod 2 = 0. L[0]=0, so we remove the 0 from L
 *       and add it to the end of P. This leads to L = [4], and P is P = [1, 2, 3, 5, 0].
 *   <li>Reached the end of the bit vector, and there is only one element left in L, the 4, which we
 *       simply add to the end of P to arrive at P = [1, 2, 3, 5, 0, 4].
