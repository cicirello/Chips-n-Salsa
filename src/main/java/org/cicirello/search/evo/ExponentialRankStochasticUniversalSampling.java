/**
 * This class implements exponential rank selection using Stochastic Universal Sampling (SUS).
 * Exponential rank selection begins be determining the rank of each population member, where the
 * least fit member of the population has rank 1, and the most fit member of the population has rank
 * N, where the population size is N. During selection, the population member with rank r is chosen
 * randomly with probability proportional to: c<sup>N-r</sup>. The c is a real-valued parameter that
 * must be in the interval (0, 1). The most-fit member of the population will be chosen with
 * probability proportional to 1, while the least-fit will be chosen with probability proportional
 * to c<sup>N-1</sup>. In the limit as c approaches 1, exponential selection converges to a uniform
 * random selection method. Whereas in the limit as c approaches 0, exponential selection converges
 * upon a degenerate selection method that chooses an entire population of copies of the single
 * most-fit population member. The lower the value of c, the faster the degree of exponential
 * decline in weight given to lower ranked population members.
 *
 * <p>However, whereas the standard form of exponential rank selection is like spinning a carnival
 * wheel with a single pointer M times to select M members of the population, this SUS version
 * instead is like spinning a carnival wheel that has M equidistant pointers a single time to select
 * all M simultaneously. One statistical consequence of this is that it reduces the variance of the
 * selected copies of population members as compared to the other approach. Another consequence is
 * that SUS is typically much faster since only a single random floating point number is needed per
 * generation, compared to M random floating-point numbers.
 *
 * <p>The runtime to select M population members from a population of size N is O(N lg N + M), which
 * includes the need to generate only a single random double, and O(M) random ints.
