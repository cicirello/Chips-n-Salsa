/**
 * This class is an implementation of the metaheuristic known as simulated annealing. Simulated
 * annealing operates via a mechanism modeled after the process of heating a metal and allowing it
 * to cool slowly. Heating enables the material to be shaped as desired, while cooling at a slow
 * rate minimizes internal stress thus enabling greater stability in the final state. Simulated
 * annealing is a form of local search inspired by this process. It is controlled by a temperature
 * parameter, T, that typically begins high, and is then typically cooled during the search (i.e., T
 * usually decreases during the search). A component of the algorithm known as the annealing
 * schedule controls how the temperature T changes during the search. Simulated annealing usually
 * begins with a random initial candidate solution to the problem. Each iteration of simulated
 * annealing then involves generating a random neighbor of the current candidate solution, and
 * deciding whether or not to accept it (if accepted, the algorithm moves to the neighbor). The
 * decision of whether or not to accept the neighbor is probabilistic. If the neighbor's cost is at
 * least as good as the current cost, then the neighbor is definitely accepted. If the neighbor's
 * cost is worse than (i.e., higher than) the current cost, then the neighbor is accepted with
 * probability, P(accept) = e<sup>(currentCost-neighborCost)/T</sup>. This is known as the Boltzmann
 * distribution. At high temperatures, there is a higher probability of accepting neighboring
 * solutions than at lower temperatures. The probability of accepting neighbors is also higher for
 * lower cost neighbors than for higher cost neighbors.
 *
 * <p>The constructors of this class enable specifying an annealing schedule via a class that
 * implements the {@link AnnealingSchedule} interface, and the library provides all of the common
 * annealing schedules, such as exponential cooling, and linear cooling, as well as a few less
 * common, such as parameter-free versions of those schedules, as well as multiple adaptive
 * annealing schedules. See the {@link AnnealingSchedule} documentation for a list of the classes
 * that implement this interface. You may also implement your own annealing schedule by implementing
 * the {@link AnnealingSchedule} interface.
 *
 * <p>You must also provide the constructors of this class with a mutation operator for generating
 * random neighbors via a class that implements the {@link UndoableMutationOperator} interface, as
 * well as an instance of a class that implements the {@link Initializer} interface to provide
 * simulated annealing with a means of generating an initial random starting solution. The library
 * provides several mutation operators for commonly optimized structures, as well as {@link
 * Initializer} objects for commonly optimized structures. You are not limited to the
 * implementations of {@link UndoableMutationOperator} and {@link Initializer} provided in the
 * library, and may implement classes that implement these interfaces as necessary for your
 * application.
 *
 * <p>This simulated annealing implementation supports an optional post-processing via a hill
 * climber. To use this feature, you must use one of the constructors that accepts a hill climber as
 * a parameter. This hill climber is then used to locally optimize the end of run solution generated
 * by simulated annealing. This hill climber must implement the {@link SimpleLocalMetaheuristic}
 * interface, such as the most commonly used hill climbers (steepest descent and first descent)
 * implemented by the {@link org.cicirello.search.hc.SteepestDescentHillClimber
 * SteepestDescentHillClimber} and {@link org.cicirello.search.hc.FirstDescentHillClimber
 * FirstDescentHillClimber} classes.
