/**
 * Implementation of the crossover operator for permutations that is often referred to as Order
 * Crossover 2 (OX2). It is rather different in function than the original Order Crossover (OX),
 * implemented in class {@link OrderCrossover}. OX2, which was introduced by Syswerda (see reference
 * below), is very nearly identical to Uniform Order Based Crossover (UOBX) also introduced by
 * Syswerda in the same paper. UOBX is implemented in the {@link UniformOrderBasedCrossover} class.
 * Each child produced by OX2 from a given pair of parents can be produced by UOBX from the same
 * pair of parents. Likewise each child produced by UOBX from a given pair of parents can be
 * produced by OX2 from the same pair of parents. However, the pair of children produced by OX2 from
 * a given pair of parents will typically differ from the pair of children produced by UOBX and vice
 * versa. Therefore, OX2 and UOBX are not exactly equivalent. However, it is not clear whether there
 * is ever an occasion when either one will lead to significantly different performance relative to
 * the other. The Chips-n-Salsa library includes both operators in the interest of comprehensiveness
 * with respect to commonly encountered permutation crossover operators.
 *
 * <p>OX2 begins by selecting a random set of indexes. The original description implied each index
 * equally likely chosen as not chosen. However, in our implementation, we provide a parameter u,
 * which is the probability that an index is chosen, much like the parameter of a uniform crossover
 * for bit-strings. We provide a constructor with a default of u=0.5. The elements at those indexes
 * in parent p2 are found in parent p1. Child c1 is then a copy of p1 but with those elements
 * rearranged into the relative order from p2. In a similar way, the elements at the chosen indexes
 * in parent p1 are found in parent p2. Child c2 is then a copy of p2 but with those elements
 * rearranged into the relative order from p1.
 *
 * <p>Consider this example. Let p1 = [1, 0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6] and p2 = [6, 7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1].
 * Let the random indexes include: 1, 2, 6, and 7. The elements at those indexes in p2, ordered as
 * in p2, are: 7, 4, 0, 1. These are therefore rearranged within p1 to produce c1 = [7, 4, 3, 2, 5,
 * 0, 1, 6]. The elements at the random indexes in p1, ordered as in p1, are: 0, 3, 7, 6. These are
 * therefore rearranged within p2 to produce c2 = [0, 3, 4, 5, 2, 7, 6, 1].
 *
 * <p>The worst case runtime of a call to {@link #cross cross} is O(n), where n is the length of the
 * permutations.
 *
 * <p>OX2 was introduced in the following paper:<br>
 * Syswerda, G. Schedule Optimization using Genetic Algorithms. <i>Handbook of Genetic
 * Algorithms</i>, 1991.
 *
 * <p>Although it got its name Order Crossover 2 (OX2) from others in order to distinguish it from
 * the original OX, such as this paper:<br>
 * T. Starkweather, S McDaniel, K Mathias, D Whitley, and C Whitley. A Comparison of Genetic
 * Sequencing Operators. <i>Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Genetic
 * Algorithms</i>, pages 69-76, 1991.
