/**
 * This class implements a (1+1)-GA, a special case of a (1+1)-EA, where solutions are represented
 * with a vector of bits. In a (1+1)-EA, the evolutionary algorithm has a population size of 1, in
 * each cycle of the algorithm a single mutant is created from that single population member,
 * forming a population of size 2, and finally the EA keeps the better of the two solutions. This is
 * perhaps the simplest case of an EA. This class supports optimizing BitVector objects. Mutation is
 * the standard bit-flip mutation of a genetic algorithm, where a mutation rate M specifies the
 * probability that each bit flips (from 0 to 1 or vice versa) during a mutation.
