/**
 * This class implements a scramble mutation on permutations, where one mutation consists in
 * randomizing the order of a randomly selected subpermutation. The pair of indexes that indicate
 * the subpermutation to scramble is chosen uniformly at random from among all n(n-1)/2 possible
 * pairs of indexes, where n is the length of the permutation.
 *
 * <p>The runtime (worst case and average case) of the {@link #mutate(Permutation) mutate} method is
 * O(n), where n is the length of the permutation. The worst case runtime occurs when the random
 * indexes are the two end points. On average, a scramble mutation moves approximately n/3 elements.
