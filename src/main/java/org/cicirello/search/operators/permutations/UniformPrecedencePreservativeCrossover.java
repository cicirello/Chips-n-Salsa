/**
 * Implementation of Precedence Preservative Crossover (PPX), the uniform version. The paper by
 * Bierwirth et al, which introduced PPX, described two versions of the operator, including the
 * uniform version that is implemented by this class, and a two-point version implemented by the
 * {@link PrecedencePreservativeCrossover} class. They referred to both simply as PPX in that paper,
 * but these are essentially two very similar, closely related crossover operators.
 *
 * <p>The paper that originally described PPX described it as producing one child from the cross of
 * two parents. However, our implementation generalizes this in the obvious way to producing two
 * children from two parents. In the uniform version of PPX, we begin with a random array of
 * booleans the same length as the parent permutations. In the Bierwirth et al paper, it was
 * described with a random array of 1s and 2s, but this is clearly equivalent to booleans. In our
 * implementation, we use a parameter U as the probability of a true. The Bierwirth et al paper
 * didn't specify, implying equally likely or 0.5. One of this class's constructors defaults U = 0.5
 * for this reason. Each index of the boolean array controls whether the corresponding index of a
 * child permutation c1 comes from parent p1 or parent p2. If true, the next element of child c1 is
 * the first element left-to-right from parent p1 that is not yet in c1; and if false, the next
 * element of child c1 is the first element left-to-right from parent p2 that is not yet in c1.
 * Likewise, if true, the next element of child c2 is the first element left-to-right from parent p2
 * that is not yet in c2; and if false, the next element of child c2 is the first element
 * left-to-right from parent p1 that is not yet in c2.
 *
 * <p>Consider this example with parent p1 = [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0] and parent p2 = [0, 1, 2, 3,
 * 4, 5, 6, 7]. Without loss of generality, we'll use 0s and 1s for our example boolean array: [0,
 * 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]. Child c1 gets its first element from p2, beginning with c1 = [0]. The next
 * element of the boolean array is 1, so c1 gets its next element from p1 for c1 = [0, 7]. The next
 * 3 elements of the boolean array are 0s, so c1 gets its next 3 elements from p2 for c1 = [0, 7, 1,
 * 2, 3, 6]. It then gets its next element from p1 because of the 1 in the next spot of the boolean
 * array. The next element comes from p2 for c1 = [0, 7, 1, 2, 3, 6, 4]. And the final element comes
 * from p1, although since there is only 1 unused element it doesn't really matter. The final c1 =
 * [0, 7, 1, 2, 3, 6, 4, 5]. We can form c2 in a similar way, but the meaning of the 0s and 1s in
 * the boolean array is flipped. The result is c2 = [7, 0, 6, 5, 4, 1, 3, 2].
 *
 * <p>The worst case runtime of a call to {@link #cross cross} is O(n), where n is the length of the
 * permutations.
 *
 * <p>PPX was introduced in the following paper:<br>
 * Bierwirth, C., Mattfeld, D., and Kopfer, H. On permutation representations for scheduling
 * problems. <i>Proceedings of the International Conference on Parallel Problem Solving from
 * Nature</i>, 1996, pp. 310-318.
