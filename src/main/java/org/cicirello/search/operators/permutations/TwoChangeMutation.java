/**
 * This class implements the classic two-change operator as a mutation operator for permutations.
 * The two-change operator originated as a local search operator for the TSP that removes two edges
 * from a tour of the cities of a TSP and replaces them with two different edges such that the
 * result is a valid tour of the cities. This implementation is not strictly for the TSP, and will
 * operate on a permutation regardless of what that permutation represents. However, it assumes that
 * the permutation represents a cyclic sequence of edges, and specifically that if two elements are
 * adjacent in the permutation that it corresponds to an undirected edge between the elements. For
 * example, consider the permutation, p = [2, 1, 4, 0, 3], of the first 5 non-negative integers. Now
 * imagine that we have a graph with 5 vertexes, labeled 0 to 4. This example permutation would
 * correspond to a set of undirected edges: { (2, 1), (1, 4), (4, 0), (0, 3), (3, 2) }. Notice that
 * we included (3, 2) here in that the set of edges represented by the permutation is cyclic and
 * includes an edge between the two endpoints. The classic two-change removes two edges and replaces
 * them with two different edges that reconnect a valid traversal of all elements. One way of
 * implementing the equivalent of this as an operator on permutations is to reverse a subsequence.
 * For example, consider reversing the first 3 elements, which gives you: p = [4, 1, 2, 0, 3], which
 * under the edge interpretation corresponds to the edges: { (4, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (0, 3), (3, 4)
 * }. Remember that we are interpreting the edges as undirected edges, and that there are exactly
 * two that have changed: (4, 0) and (3, 2) were removed, and replaced by (2, 0) and (3, 4).
 *
 * <p>Technically, if you wanted to use the approximate equivalent of a two change operator, you
 * could use the {@link ReversalMutation} class. The reason is that every two change is equivalent
 * to a reversal. However, not every reversal is equivalent to a two change. If you reverse the
 * entire permutation, you don't actually change any edges, if the permutation represents a cyclic
 * set of undirected edges. Likewise, if you reverse an n-1 length sequence of elements, you also
 * don't change any edges. This TwoChangeMutation class implements a two change operator that always
 * produces a mutant that is the equivalent to changing two edges (if that is what the permutation
 * represents). For example, it won't reverse the entire permutation, and also won't reverse a
 * subpermutation of length n-1. Additionally, simply viewing reversals as two changes leads to
 * redundancy (e.g., reversing the first k elements changes the same two edges as reversing the last
 * n-k elements), so if your aim is to perform two changes, and if you want all possible two changes
 * to be equally likely when generating a random mutant, then the {@link ReversalMutation} class
 * will not give you that since it will be biased in favor of the two changes that have multiple
 * equivalent reversals. This TwoChangeMutation class is implemented such that all two changes of a
 * permutation are approximately equally likely.
 *
 * <p>Also note that this TwoChangeMutation doesn't guarantee implementation by reversals. It only
 * guarantees that every mutation is equivalent to a two change (under the interpretation of a
 * permutation representing a cyclic set of edges), and that all possible such two changes are
 * equally likely. Under this assumption some two changes can be generated faster than by a
 * reversal.
 *
 * <p>The runtime (worst case and average case) of both the {@link #mutate(Permutation) mutate} and
 * {@link #undo(Permutation) undo} methods is O(n), where n is the length of the permutation. During
 * a single call to one of these methods, at most n/2 elements will change locations. Thus, this is
 * roughly twice as fast as the {@link ReversalMutation} class, which can move as many as n elements
 * during a single call to these methods. If the set of edges interpretation applies to your
 * problem, then the TwoChangeMutation may be a better choice than ReversalMutation. At the very
 * least it will compute mutants faster. If that interpretation doesn't apply to your problem, then
 * we can't really say (at least not in a problem independent way) which might be better.
 *
 * <p>For any given permutation of length n, there are n*(n-3)/2 possible two-change neighbors. For
 * permutations of length n &lt; 4, the TwoChangeMutation operator makes no changes, as there are no
 * two-change neighbors of permutations of that size.
