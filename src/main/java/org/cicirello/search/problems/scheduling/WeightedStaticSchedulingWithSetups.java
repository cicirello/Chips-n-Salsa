/**
 * This class provides a representation of, and means of generating, instances of single machine
 * scheduling problems involving weights, due dates, and sequence-dependent setup times, but without
 * release dates (i.e., all jobs are released at the start of the problem at time 0, thus, the term
 * "static" in the class name).
 *
 * <p>This class generates instances using a procedure largely based upon that which was used to
 * generate the benchmark instances for weighted tardiness scheduling with sequence-dependent setups
 * described in the following paper, and with instances now available at the following Harvard
 * Dataverse site:
 *
 * <ul>

 *       href="https://www.cicirello.org/publications/cicirello2003cmu.html">Weighted Tardiness
 *       Scheduling with Sequence-Dependent Setups: A Benchmark Library</a>. Technical Report,
 *       Intelligent Coordination and Logistics Laboratory, Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon
 *       University, Pittsburgh, PA, February 2003.
 *   <li>Vincent A. Cicirello. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/VHA0VQ">Weighted Tardiness
 *       Scheduling with Sequence-Dependent Setups: A Benchmark Library</a>. Harvard Dataverse,
 *       doi:10.7910/DVN/VHA0VQ, June 2016.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>That approach was based on the description of generating instances for that scheduling problem
 * described in the following paper:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Lee, Y. H., Bhaskaran, K., and Pinedo, M. A heuristic to minimize the total weighted
 *       tardiness with sequence-dependent setups. IIE Transactions, 29:45â€“52, 1997.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The Chips-n-Salsa library separates the representation of the scheduling problem instance data
 * (e.g., processing times, setup times, etc) from the implementations of scheduling cost functions
 * deliberately to enable defining additional problems (i.e., different cost functions to optimize)
 * using the same scheduling problem generators. This is very much like what was suggested in the
 * following paper:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Vincent A. Cicirello. <a
 *       href="https://www.cicirello.org/publications/cicirello2007icaps.html">The Challenge of
 *       Sequence-Dependent Setups: Proposal for a Scheduling Competition Track on One Machine
 *       Sequencing Problems</a>. Proceedings of the International Conference on Automated Planning
 *       and Scheduling (ICAPS) Workshop on Scheduling a Scheduling Competition. AAAI Press,
 *       September 2007.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This is a reimplementation of the above problem instance generator, using a more efficient
 * random number generator, and a better estimator of makespan (which is used in determining the
 * random due dates).
 *
 * <p>The constructors that generate random scheduling problem instances take four parameters: n,
 * &tau;, r, and &eta;. These parameters are defined as follows. The number of jobs in the instance
 * is n. &tau; controls due date tightness, and r controls the due date range. &eta; controls the
 * severity of the setup times. The values of &tau;, r, and &eta; are required to be in the interval
 * [0.0, 1.0].
 *
 * <p>Instances are then generated randomly as follows. The processing time p[j] of job j is
 * generated uniformly at random from: [50, 150]. The mean processing time is thus: p&#772; = 100.
 * The weight w[j] of job j is generated uniformly at random from: [0, 10]. To generate the random
 * setup times, first define the mean setup time as: s&#772; = &eta;p&#772;. The setup time s[i][j]
 * of job j if it immediately follows job i on the machine is generated uniformly at random from:
 * [0, 2s&#772;]. To generate the random due dates, first define the mean due date d&#772; as
 * d&#772; = (1 - &tau;)C<sub>max</sub>, where C<sub>max</sub> is an estimate of makespan (see
 * below). With probability &tau;, we generate the due date d[j] of job j uniformly at random from
 * the interval: [d&#772; - rd&#772;, d&#772;]; and with probability (1 - &tau;), we generate it
 * uniformly at random from [d&#772;, d&#772; + r(C<sub>max</sub> - d&#772;)]. The makespan,
 * C<sub>max</sub>, is estimated based on Lee et al's (see references above) estimate:
 * C<sub>max</sub> = n(p&#772; + &beta;s&#772;), where &beta; &le; 1.0. Lee et al's rationale for
 * including the &beta; factor is that the optimal schedule will tend to favor job transitions that
 * involve lower than average setups. Lee et al's paper provided data on how &beta; varies for a
 * couple specific problem sizes n. They don't derive a general rule, however, an examination of the
 * limited data in their paper shows that &beta; appears to decrease logarithmically in n. We fit a
 * curve to the couple data points available in Lee et al's paper and estimate: &beta; = -0.097
 * ln(n) + 0.6876, but we don't allow &beta; to fall below 0.2.
