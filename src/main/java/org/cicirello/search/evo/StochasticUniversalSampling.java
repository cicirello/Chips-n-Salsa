/**
 * This class implements Stochastic Universal Sampling (SUS), a selection operator for evolutionary
 * algorithms. In SUS, similarly to fitness proportional selection, a member of the population is
 * chosen randomly with probability proportional to its fitness relative to the total fitness of the
 * population. For example, if the fitness of population member i is f<sub>i</sub>, then the
 * probability of selecting population member i is: f<sub>i</sub> / &sum;<sub>j</sub> f<sub>j</sub>,
 * for j &isin; { 1, 2, ..., N }, where N is the population size.
 *
 * <p>However, whereas fitness proportional selection is like spinning a carnival wheel with a
 * single pointer M times to select M members of the population, SUS instead is like spinning a
 * carnival wheel that has M equidistant pointers a single time to select all M simultaneously. One
 * statistical consequence of this is that it reduces the variance of the selected copies of
 * population members as compared to fitness proportional selection. Another consequence is that SUS
 * is typically much faster since only a single random floating point number is needed per
 * generation, compared to M random floating-point numbers for fitness proportional selection.
 * However, SUS then must randomize the ordering of the population to avoid all of the copies of a
 * single population member from being in sequence so that parent assignment is random, whereas
 * fitness proportional selection has this property built in.
 *
 * <p><b>This selection operator requires positive fitness values. Behavior is undefined if any
 * fitness values are less than or equal to 0.</b> If your fitness values may be negative, you can
 * use {@link FitnessShifter}, which transforms fitness values such that minimum fitness equals 1.
 *
 * <p>The runtime to select M population members from a population of size N is O(N + M), which
 * includes the need to generate only a single random double, and O(M) random ints.
