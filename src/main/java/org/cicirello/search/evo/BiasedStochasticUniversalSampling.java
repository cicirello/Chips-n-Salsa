/**
 * This class implements a variation of Stochastic Universal Sampling (SUS) that we call Biased
 * Stochastic Universal Sampling (Biased SUS), which integrates the use of a bias function with SUS
 * to enable transforming fitness values prior to the stochastic selection decisions. In this Biased
 * SUS, a member of the population is chosen randomly with probability proportional to a bias
 * function of its fitness relative to the total of such biased fitness of the population. For
 * example, if the fitness of population member i is f<sub>i</sub>, then the probability of
 * selecting population member i is: bias(f<sub>i</sub>) / &sum;<sub>j</sub> bias(f<sub>j</sub>),
 * for j &isin; { 1, 2, ..., N }, where N is the population size, and bias is a bias function.
 *
 * <p>As an example bias function, consider: bias(x) = x<sup>2</sup>, which would square each
 * fitness value x.
 *
 * <p>SUS and this Biased SUS are similar to fitness proportional selection and a biased variation
 * of fitness proportional selection. However, whereas fitness proportional selection is like
 * spinning a carnival wheel with a single pointer M times to select M members of the population,
 * SUS instead is like spinning a carnival wheel that has M equidistant pointers a single time to
 * select all M simultaneously. One statistical consequence of this is that it reduces the variance
 * of the selected copies of population members as compared to fitness proportional selection (and
 * its biased variation). Another consequence is that SUS and Biased SUS are typically much faster
 * since only a single random floating point number is needed per generation, compared to M random
 * floating-point numbers for fitness proportional selection. However, SUS and Biased SUS then must
 * randomize the ordering of the population to avoid all of the copies of a single population member
 * from being in sequence so that parent assignment is random, whereas fitness proportional
 * selection has this property built in.
 *
 * <p><b>This selection operator requires positive fitness values. Behavior is undefined if any
 * fitness values are less than or equal to 0.</b> If your fitness values may be negative, you can
 * use {@link FitnessShifter}, which transforms fitness values such that minimum fitness equals 1.
 *
 * <p>The runtime to select M population members from a population of size N is O(N + M), which
 * includes the need to generate only a single random double, and O(M) ints. This assumes that the
 * bias function has a constant runtime.
 *
 * <p>For the more common standard version of SUS, see the {@link StochasticUniversalSampling}
 * class.
