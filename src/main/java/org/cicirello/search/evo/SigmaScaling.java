/**
 * Implements sigma scaling by wrapping your chosen selection operator. The SigmaScaling instance
 * applies sigma scaling to the fitnesses of the population, passing the scaled fitnesses to the
 * true selection operator.
 *
 * <p>The fitness, f<sub>i</sub>, of population member i is transformed as follows: f'<sub>i</sub> =
 * f<sub>i</sub> - ( f&#773; - c * &sigma; ), where c is a parameter usually between 1 and 3,
 * inclusive. &sigma; is the standard deviation of the fitnesses of the population, and f&#773; is
 * average fitness. For any members of the population for which this transformation produces a
 * fitness less than 0.001, it is reset to 0.001.
 *
 * <p>The intended use-case is to use in combination with a fitness weighted selection operator,
 * such as {@link FitnessProportionalSelection}, {@link StochasticUniversalSampling}, {@link
 * BiasedFitnessProportionalSelection}, or {@link BiasedStochasticUniversalSampling}. Here is an
 * example of how to instantiate an instance of a selection operator using SigmaScaling:
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * SelectionOperator selection = new SigmaScaling(new FitnessProportionalSelection(), 2);
 * </code></pre>
