/**
 * Implementation of uniform crossover, but for RealVectors. In uniform crossover, instead of a
 * fixed number of cross points, the crossover operator is controlled by a parameter, p, that is the
 * probability that the values at a position are exchanged between the two parents. If the length of
 * the vectors is N, then N independent random decisions are made regarding whether to exchange each
 * position between the parents in forming the children. The expected number of values exchanged
 * between the parents during a single crossover event is thus p*N. The most common value for p=0.5,
 * which leads to each child inheriting on average half of the values from each of the two parents.
 * Uniform crossover originated for crossover of bit vectors within a genetic algorithm, but has
 * been adapted here for vectors of doubles.
