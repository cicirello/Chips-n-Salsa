/**
 * Implementation of single point crossover, but for RealVectors. In a single point crossover, a
 * random cross point is chosen uniformly along the length of the parents. Both parents are cut at
 * that point. Each child gets the elements before the cross point from one parent, and the elements
 * after the cross point from the other parent. Single point crossover originated for crossover of
 * bit vectors within a genetic algorithm, but has been adapted here for vectors of doubles.
