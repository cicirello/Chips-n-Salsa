/**
 * Implementation of the Edge Recombination operator, a crossover operator for permutations. Edge
 * Recombination assumes that the permutations represent a cyclic sequence of edges. That is, if 3
 * follows 5 in the permutation, then that corresponds to an undirected edge between 3 and 5. Given
 * this assumption, it is suitable for problems where permutations do represent a sequence of edges
 * such as the traveling salesperson. However, the Chips-n-Salsa library does not limit its use to
 * such problems, and you can use it on any problem with solutions represented as permutations.
 *
 * <p>Imagine a hypothetical graph consisting of the n elements of a permutation of length n as the
 * n vertexes of the graph. The edge set begins with the n adjacent pairs from parent p1. For
 * example, if p1 = [3, 0, 2, 1, 4], then the edge set of this graph is initialized with the
 * undirected edges: (3, 0), (0, 2), (2, 1), (1, 4), and (4, 3). Now add to that edge set any edges,
 * determined in a similar way, from parent p2, provided it doesn't already contain the relevant
 * edge. Consider p2 = [4, 3, 2, 1, 0]. Thus, we would add (3, 2), (1, 0),and (0, 4) to get an
 * undirected edge set of: { (3, 0), (0, 2), (2, 1), (1, 4), (4, 3), (3, 2), (1, 0), (0, 4) }. Child
 * c1 is initialized with the first element of parent p1, in this example p1 = [3]. We then examine
 * the adjacent vertexes to the most recently added element. The 3 is adjacent to 0, 4, and 2. We'll
 * pick one of these to add in the next spot of the permutation. We'll pick the one that is adjacent
 * to the fewest elements not yet used. 0 is adjacent to 2, 1, and 4. 4 is adjacent to 1 and 0. 2 is
 * adjacent to 0 and 1. When there is a tie, such as here with the 2 and 4, the tie is broken at
 * random. Imagine that the random tie breaker gave us 4. We now have p1 = [3, 4]. We now consider
 * the adjacent elements of 4 that are not yet in the permutation, which in this case is 0 and 1. We
 * pick the one with the fewest adjacent elements not yet in the permutation. The 0 is adjacent to 1
 * and 2. The 1 is adjacent to 0 and 2. Since we have a tie, we pick randomly. Consider for the
 * example that the random choice have us 1. We now have p1 = [3, 4, 1]. We now examine the adjacent
 * elements of 1 that are not yet in the permutation. The 1 is adjacent to 0 and 2. We pick the one
 * that is adjacent to the fewest not yet used elements. They are the only two remaining and they
 * are adjacent to each other. We thus pick randomly. Consider that the random element is 0, and we
 * now have p1 = [3, 4, 1, 0]. And at this point, there is only one element left, so the final
 * permutation is p1 = [3, 4, 1, 0, 2]. We can form the other child in a similar way, but
 * initialized with the first element of the other parent.
 *
 * <p>The Edge Recombination operator uses a special data structure that its creators, Whitley et
 * al, call an edge map for efficient implementation.
 *
 * <p>The worst case runtime of a call to {@link #cross cross} is O(n), where n is the length of the
 * permutations.
 *
 * <p>The edge recombination operator was introduced in the following paper:<br>
 * D. Whitley, T. Starkweather, and D. Fuquay. Scheduling Problems and Traveling Salesmen: The
 * Genetic Edge Recombination Operator. <i>Proceedings of the International Conference on Genetic
 * Algorithms</i>, 1989, pp. 133-140.
