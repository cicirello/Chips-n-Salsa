/**
 * Implementation of uniform order-based crossover (UOBX). UOBX is controlled by a parameter U,
 * which is the probability that an index is a fixed-point for children relative to parents (i.e.,
 * that the children get the elements at those positions from the parents). Child c1 gets the
 * absolute positions of U*N elements on average from parent p1, where N is the permutation length,
 * and c1 gets the relative positions of the remaining elements from parent p2. Likewise, child c2
 * gets the absolute positions of elements at those same chosen indexes from p2, with the relative
 * positions of the others coming from p1.
 *
 * <p>Consider an example to illustrate. Let parent p1 = [3, 0, 6, 2, 5, 1, 4, 7] and parent p2 =
 * [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]. Consider U=0.5, and imagine in this hypothetical scenario that exactly
 * half of the indexes were chosen, and that those 4 indexes are: 0, 3, 4, 6. Child c1 will get the
 * elements at those indexes from p1, thus c1 begins with [3, x, x, 2, 5, x, 4, x]. The missing
 * elements, 0, 1, 6, 7 will get their relative ordering from p2, and thus will be ordered as: 7, 6,
 * 1, 0. In that order, they will fill into the open spots to derive: c1 = [3, 7, 6, 2, 5, 1, 4, 0].
 * Likewise, c2 will get the elements from indexes 0, 3, 4, and 6 from p2 to initialize as [7, x, x,
 * 4, 3, x, 1, x]. Its missing elements, 0, 2, 5, and 6 will get relative order from p1, and thus
 * will be ordered 0, 6, 2, 5 to derive c2 = [7, 0, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1, 5].
 *
 * <p>The worst case runtime of a call to {@link #cross cross} is O(n), where n is the length of the
 * permutations.
 *
 * <p>UOBX was introduced in the following paper:<br>
 * Syswerda, G. Schedule Optimization using Genetic Algorithms. <i>Handbook of Genetic
 * Algorithms</i>, 1991.
