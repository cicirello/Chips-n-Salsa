/**
 * This class provides a representation of, and means of generating, instances of single machine
 * scheduling problems involving weights and due dates, but without release dates (i.e., all jobs
 * are released at the start of the problem at time 0, thus, the term "static" in the class name).
 *
 * <p>This class generates instances using a procedure based on that used to generate the benchmark
 * instances for weighted tardiness scheduling that are available in the <a
 * href=http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mastjjb/jeb/orlib/wtinfo.html>OR-Library of J.E. Beasley</a>.
 * Note that this is NOT the implementation that generated those instances. Rather, this
 * implementation is based on the description of that generator. That <a
 * href=https://github.com/cicirello/scheduling-benchmarks/tree/master/wt>description</a>, along
 * with a set of benchmark instances, is mirrored in the following GitHub repository: <a
 * href=https://github.com/cicirello/scheduling-benchmarks>https://github.com/cicirello/scheduling-benchmarks</a>
 *
 * <p>The Chips-n-Salsa library separates the representation of the scheduling problem instance data
 * (e.g., processing times, weights, etc) from the implementations of scheduling cost functions
 * deliberately to enable defining additional problems (i.e., different cost functions to optimize)
 * using the same scheduling problem generators. This is very much like what was suggested in the
 * following paper:
