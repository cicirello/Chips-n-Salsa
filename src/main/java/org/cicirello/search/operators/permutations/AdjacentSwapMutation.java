 * This class implements an adjacent swap mutation on permutations, where one mutation consists in
 * randomly swapping a pair of adjacent elements. The random choice of elements is performed
 * uniformly at random from among all adjacent pairs. If the length of the permutation is n, there
 * are n-1 such adjacent pairs. The runtime of both the {@link #mutate(Permutation) mutate} and
 * {@link #undo(Permutation) undo} methods is O(1).
