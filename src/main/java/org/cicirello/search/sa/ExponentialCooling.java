/**
 * This class implements the classic and most commonly encountered cooling schedule for simulated
 * annealing, the annealing schedule known as exponential cooling (sometimes referred to as
 * geometric cooling). In this cooling schedule, the k-th temperature, t<sub>k</sub>, is determined
 * as follows: t<sub>k</sub> = &alpha;<sup>k</sup> * t<sub>0</sub>, where t<sub>0</sub> is the
 * initial temperature and &alpha; is the cooling rate. The new temperature is usually computed
 * incrementally from the previous with: t<sub>k</sub> = &alpha; * t<sub>k-1</sub>. In some
 * applications, the temperature update occurs with each simulated annealing evaluation, while in
 * others it is updated periodically, such as every s steps (i.e., iterations) of simulated
 * annealing. This class supports this periodic update approach, with a default of every step. See
 * the parameters of the constructors for more information.
 *
 * <p>Additionally, this class stops updating the temperature once it is less than or equal to
 * 0.001. For any foreseeable cost scale that a problem may have, a temperature value of 0.001 is
 * sufficiently low such that all moves that are worse than the current state will be rejected, so
 * further cooling would be superfluous.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #accept accept} methods of this class use the classic, and most common, Boltzmann
 * distribution for determining whether to accept a neighbor.
