/**
 * Implementation of the Enhanced Edge Recombination operator, a crossover operator for
 * permutations. Enhanced Edge Recombination is an improvement over the original Edge Recombination
 * operator. Both the original and the Enhanced Edge Recombination assumes that the permutations
 * represent a cyclic sequence of edges. That is, if 3 follows 5 in the permutation, then that
 * corresponds to an undirected edge between 3 and 5. Given this assumption, it is suitable for
 * problems where permutations do represent a sequence of edges such as the traveling salesperson.
 * However, the Chips-n-Salsa library does not limit its use to such problems, and you can use it on
 * any problem with solutions represented as permutations.
 *
 * <p>The original Edge Recombination operator, implemented in the {@link EdgeRecombination} class,
 * is designed to create children that inherit undirected edges from the parents. A child
 * permutation inherited an edge (i,j), if i and j are in adjacent positions anywhere in the child,
 * and if there is at least one parent that likewise includes i and j in adjacent positions. Since
 * the operator considers edges to be undirected, the order also doesn't matter. For example, if j
 * immediately follows i in the child, then a parent may have been such that i immediately followed
 * j. And since it considers the permutation to be a cycle, the two endpoints are considered to be
 * adjacent. The documentation of the {@link EdgeRecombination} class includes an explanation of the
 * inner workings of the operator, along with an example.
 *
 * <p>The Enhanced Edge Recombination operator additionally attempts to create children that inherit
 * common subsequences of edges from the parents. It does so using a modified version of the edge
 * map data structure introduced by Whitley et al for efficient implementation of the original Edge
 * Recombination. Starkweather et al's modification involves augmenting the edge map to mark the
 * edges that the parents have in common. Then, when constructing the child, during the decision of
 * which element to add next to the permutation, an edge that is the start of a common subsequence
 * of edges is preferred over other edges from the parents.
 *
 * <p>We leave the details to the paper that introduced the Enhanced Edge Recombination operator:
 * <br>
 * T. Starkweather, S McDaniel, K Mathias, D Whitley, and C Whitley. A Comparison of Genetic
 * Sequencing Operators. <i>Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Genetic
 * Algorithms</i>, pages 69-76, 1991.
 *
 * <p>The worst case runtime of a call to {@link #cross cross} is O(n), where n is the length of the
 * permutations.
