/**
 * Implementation of partially matched crossover (PMX). Partially matched crossover begins by
 * selecting a random segment, much like a 2-point crossover for bit-strings. PMX then initializes
 * the children as copies of the parents, and proceeds to make a sequence of swaps within child c1
 * as to cause c1 at the end of those swaps to contain the cross region of p2 within its cross
 * region,. And similarly for the other child.
 *
 * <p>Consider as an example parent permutation p1 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] and parent permutation
 * p2 = [1, 2, 0, 5, 6, 7, 4, 3]. Now consider that the random cross region begins at index 2 and
 * ends at index 4, inclusive. Child c1 is initialized as a copy of p1, c1 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
 * 7], and we then swap the 2 with the 0 (the elements at index 2 in the parents) to get c1 = [2, 1,
 * 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Next, we swap the 3 with the 5 (the elements at index 3 in the parents) to get
 * c1 = [2, 1, 0, 5, 4, 3, 6, 7]. Finally, we swap the 4 with the 6 (the elements at index 4 in the
 * parents) to end up with c1 = [2, 1, 0, 5, 6, 3, 4, 7]. In a similar way, we initialize c2 as a
 * copy of p2 and proceed with the designated swaps to end up with c2 = [1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 6, 5].
 *
 * <p>PMX was introduced in the following paper:<br>
 * Goldberg, D.E. and Lingle, R. Alleles, Loci, and the Traveling Salesman Problem. <i>Proceedings
 * of the 1st International Conference on Genetic Algorithms</i>, 1985, pp. 154-159.
 *
 * <p>Although, we actually relied on the seminal book on genetic algorithms by one of PMX's authors
 * David E Goldberg:<br>
 * Goldberg, D.E. <i>Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization and Machine Learning</i>, Addison
 * Wesley, 1989.
 *
 * <p>Note that this implementation in Chips-n-Salsa is asymptotically faster than Goldberg and
 * Lingle's algorithmic description of PMX. In the original PMX description, the indexes of the
 * elements to swap were found with a linear search, and since on average there is a linear number
 * of these, PMX as originally described required O(n<sup>2</sup>) time. However, the implementation
 * here in Chips-n-Salsa computes the inverse of each permutation in linear time, which is then used
 * as a lookup table for the indexes of the elements to swap. Each swap is constant time, and also
 * involves a constant time update to the lookup table of indexes. Thus, this implementation, the
 * {@link #cross cross} method, has an average case and worst case runtime of O(n), where n is
 * permutation length.
