/**
 * This class implements a variation of fitness proportional selection that applies a bias function
 * to transform the fitness values. In this biased fitness proportional selection, a member of the
 * population is chosen randomly with probability proportional to a bias function of its fitness
 * relative to the total of such biased fitness of the population. For example, if the fitness of
 * population member i is f<sub>i</sub>, then the probability of selecting population member i is:
 * bias(f<sub>i</sub>) / &sum;<sub>j</sub> bias(f<sub>j</sub>), for j &isin; { 1, 2, ..., N }, where
 * N is the population size, and bias is a bias function. To select M members of the population, M
 * independent random decisions are executed in this way, thus requiring generating M random numbers
 * of type double.
 *
 * <p>As an example bias function, consider: bias(x) = x<sup>2</sup>, which would square each
 * fitness value x.
 *
 * <p><b>This selection operator requires positive fitness values. Behavior is undefined if any
 * fitness values are less than or equal to 0.</b> If your fitness values may be negative, you can
 * use {@link FitnessShifter}, which transforms fitness values such that minimum fitness equals 1.
 *
 * <p>The runtime to select M population members from a population of size N is O(N + M lg N),
 * assuming the bias function has a constant runtime.
 *
 * <p>For the more common standard version of fitness proportional selection, see the {@link
 * FitnessProportionalSelection} class.
