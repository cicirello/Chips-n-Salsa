/**
 * Value Biased Stochastic Sampling (VBSS) is a form of stochastic sampling search that uses a
 * constructive heuristic to bias the random decisions. In VBSS, the search generates N random
 * candidate solutions to the problem, using a problem-specific heuristic to bias each random
 * decision in favor of choices that are preferred by the heuristic. It evaluates each of the N
 * candidate solutions with respect to the optimization problem's cost function, and returns the
 * best of the N candidate solutions.
 *
 * <p>Although the VBSS algorithm itself is not restricted to permutation problems, the examples
 * that follow in this documentation focus on permutations for illustrative purposes.
 *
 * <p>Let's consider an illustrative example. Consider a problem whose solution is to be represented
 * with a permutation of length L of the integers {0, 1, ..., (L-1)}. For the sake of this example,
 * let L=4. Thus, we are searching for a permutation of the integers {0, 1, 2, 3}. We will
 * iteratively build up a partial permutation containing a subset of the elements into a complete
 * permutation.
 *
 * <p>We begin with an empty partial permutation: p = []. The first iteration will select the first
 * element. To do so, we use a heuristic to evaluate each option within the context of the problem.
 * Let S be the set of elements not yet in the permutation, which in this case is initially S = {0,
 * 1, 2, 3}. Let h(p, e) be a constructive heuristic that takes as input the current partial
 * permutation p, and an element e from S under consideration for addition to p, and which produces
 * a real value as output that increases as the importance of adding e to p increases. That is,
 * higher values of the heuristic imply that the heuristic has a higher level of confidence that the
 * element e should be added next to p. For the sake of this example, consider that the heuristic
 * values are as follows: h([], 0) = 5, h([], 1) = 7, h([], 2) = 1, and h([], 3) = 1. The heuristic
 * seems to favor element 1 the most, and has element 0 as its second choice, and doesn't seem to
 * think that elements 2 and 3 are very good choices relative to the others.
 *
 * <p>Now, VBSS also uses a bias function b. We will compute b(h(p, e)) for each element e under
 * consideration for addition to partial permutation p. A common form of the bias function is b(h(p,
 * e)) = h(p, e)<sup>a</sup> for some exponent a. The greater your confidence is in the decision
 * making ability of the heuristic, the greater the exponent a should be. We'll use a=2 for this
 * example. So given our heuristic values from above, we have the following: b(h([], 0)) = 25,
 * b(h([], 1)) = 49, b(h([], 2)) = 1, and b(h([], 3)) = 1.
 *
 * <p>The element that is added to the partial permutation p is then determined randomly such that
 * the probability P(e) of choosing element e is proportional to b(h(p, e)). In this example, P(0) =
 * 25 / (25+49+1+1) = 25 / 76 = 0.329. P(1) = 49 / 76 = 0.645. P(2) = 1 / 76 = 0.013. And likewise
 * P(3) = 0.013. So slightly less than two out of every three samples, VBSS will end up beginning
 * the permutation with element 1 in this example.
 *
 * <p>For the sake of the example, let's assume that element 1 was chosen above. We now have partial
 * permutation p = [1], and the set of elements not yet added to p is S = {0, 2, 3}. We need to
 * compute h([1], e) for each of the elements e from S, and then compute b(h([1], e)). For most
 * problems, the heuristic values would have changed. For example, if the problem was the traveling
 * salesperson, then the heuristic might be in terms of the distance from the last city already in
 * the partial permutation (favoring nearby cities). As you move from city to city, which cities are
 * nearest will change. This is why one of the inputs to the heuristic must be the current partial
 * permutation. So let's assume for the example that we recompute the heuristic and get the
 * following values: h([1], 0) = 1, h([1], 2) = 4, and h([1], 3) = 3. When we compute the biases, we
 * get: b(h([1], 0)) = 1, b(h([1], 2)) = 16, and b(h([1], 3)) = 9. The selection probabilities are
 * thus: P(0) = 1 / (1+16+9) = 1 / 26 = 0.038; P(2) = 16 / 26 = 0.615; and P(3) = 9 / 26 = 0.346.
 * Although there is much higher probability of selecting element 2, there is also a reasonably high
 * chance of VBSS selecting element 3 in this case. Let's consider that it did choose element 3.
 * Thus, p is now p = [1, 3] and S = {0, 2}.
 *
 * <p>One final decision is needed in this example. Let h([1, 3], 0) = 5, and h([1, 3], 2) = 6,
 * which means b(h([1, 3], 0)) = 25, and b(h([1, 3], 2)) = 36. The selection probabilities are then:
 * P(0) = 25 / (25+36) = 25 / 61 = 0.41, and P(2) = 36 / 61 = 0.59. Let's say that element 2 was
 * chosen, so that now we have p = [0, 3, 2]. Since only one element remains, it is thus added as
 * well to get p = [0, 3, 2, 1]. This permutation is then evaluated with the optimization problem's
 * cost function, and the entire process repeated N times ultimately returning the best (lowest
 * cost) of the N randomly sampled solutions.
 *
 * <p>To use this implementation of VBSS, you will need to implement a constructive heuristic for
 * your problem using the {@link ConstructiveHeuristic} interface. The ValueBiasedStochasticSampling
 * class also provides a variety of constructors enabling defining the bias function in different
 * ways. The most basic uses the approach of the above example, allowing specifying the exponent,
 * and the default is simply an exponent of 1. The most general allows you to specify any arbitrary
 * bias function using the {@link BiasFunction} interface.
 *
 * <p>Assuming that the length of the permutation is L, and that the runtime of the constructive
 * heuristic is O(f(L)), the runtime to construct one permutation using VBSS is O(L<sup>2</sup>
 * f(L)). If the cost, f(L), to heuristically evaluate one permutation element is simply, O(1),
 * constant time, then the cost to heuristically construct one permutation with VBSS is simply
 * O(L<sup>2</sup>).
