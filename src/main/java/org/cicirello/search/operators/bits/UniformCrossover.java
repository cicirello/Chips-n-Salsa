/**
 * Implementation of uniform crossover, a classic crossover operator for BitVectors. In uniform
 * crossover, instead of a fixed number of cross points, the crossover operator is controlled by a
 * parameter, p, that is the probability that a bit is exchanged between the two parents. If the
 * BitVectors are N bits in length, then N independent random decisions are made regarding whether
 * to exchange each bit between the parents in forming the children. The expected number of bits
 * exchanged between the parents during a single crossover event is thus p*N. The most common value
 * for p=0.5, which leads to each child inheriting on average half of the bits from each of the two
 * parents.
