/**
 * This class implements a scramble mutation on permutations, where one mutation consists in
 * randomizing the order of a non-contiguous subset of the permutation elements. It is controlled by
 * a parameter U, which is the probability that an element is included in the scramble. On average,
 * you can expect U*n elements to be randomized, where n is the length of the permutation. This
 * version of uniform scramble mutation also supports the undo method.
 *
 * <p>The worst case and average case runtime of the {@link #mutate(Permutation) mutate} method is
 * O(n), where n is the length of the permutation. The worst case runtime of the {@link
 * #undo(Permutation) undo} method is also O(n), but its average runtime is O(U*n).
 *
 * <p>If you don't need the {@link #undo(Permutation) undo} method, then it is recommended that you
 * instead use the {@link UniformScrambleMutation} class instead to avoid the O(n) extra memory
 * required to store the prior permutation state, as well as the time associated with copying that
 * state prior to mutation.
